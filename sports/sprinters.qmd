## Motivation

This data comes from a compilation of official times for runners in 100m sprint
events around the world.

## Data

There are two files, one for men and one for women. Each contains the top 1,000
times (as of 2021) for men or women in the 100m sprint. Each row represents one
time.

Both data files are in tab-separated format.

### Data preview

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
source("../preview_dataset.R")
rt <- function(x) {
  read.table(file.path("../data", x), sep = "\t", quote = "", header = TRUE)
}
datasets <- sapply(c("sprint_m.txt", "sprint_w.txt"), rt, simplify = FALSE)

preview_datasets(datasets = datasets)
```

### Variable descriptions

| Variable | Description |
|----|-------------|
| Rank | Ranking of the time |
| Time | Number of seconds to complete the 100m sprint. Times have an "A" suffix if the event was at an altitude greater than 1,000 meters above sea level (e.g. "10.36A"). |
| Wind | Windspeed in meters per second. Positive number is a tailwind. |
| Name | Name of the sprinter. |
| Country | Country the sprinter represented. |
| Birthdate | When the sprinter was born (format DD.MM.YY) |
| City | Where the race took place. |
| Date | When the race took place (format DD.MM.YYYY) |

The format is the same in both data files.

## Questions

This dataset provides many opportunities for data cleaning, wrangling, and EDA.
For instance, in data cleaning:

1. The `Time` column contains a suffix to indicate if the event was at altitude.
   Create a new `Altitude` column that is true if the event was at altitude, and
   adjust `Time` to contain only the time as a number.
2. Some of the text columns contain special characters encoded as [HTML
   entities](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Character_reference).
   For instance, Ã¼ is written `&uuml;`. Use a package that can decode these to
   convert the text back to a readable format.
3. Convert the `Birthdate` and `Date` columns to your programming language's
   date objects (such as `datetime.date` in Python or `Date` objects in R). How
   do you handle two-digit years and determine which century they occurred in?


For data wrangling and split-apply-combine operations:

1. Find the fastest time achieved by runners of each country.
2. Find the fastest time recorded each year. Is this increasing or decreasing
   over time?
3. Which sprinters have the most times in the top 1,000?


For EDA:

1. Is the race time correlated with the wind speed? Do tailwinds make runners
   faster?
2. Do certain cities have faster average times than others?
