## Motivation

This data was scraped from [http://www.alltime-athletics.com/m_100ok.htm](http://www.alltime-athletics.com/m_100ok.htm)
and [http://www.alltime-athletics.com/w_100ok.htm](http://www.alltime-athletics.com/w_100ok.htm). 
It has been used as a practice for split-apply-combine operations in classes.

## Data

Each row is a record for the 100m sprint. There are two files, one for males
and one for females. The formats are the same in each file. Each file contains
1000 data points.

### Data preview

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
source("../preview_dataset.R")
rt<-function(x){
  read.table(file.path("../data",x), sep="\t", quote="", header=TRUE)
}
datasets<-sapply(c("sprint_m.txt","sprint_w.txt"),rt,simplify=FALSE)
preview_datasets(datasets=datasets)
```

### Variable descriptions

| Variable | Description |
|----|-------------|
| Rank | Ranking of the time |
| Time | Number of seconds to complete the 100m sprint |
| Wind | Windspeed in meters per second. Positive number is a tailwind. |
| Name | Name of the sprinter. |
| Country | Country the sprinter represented. |
| Birthdate | When the sprinter was born (format DD.MM.YY) |
| City | Where the race took place. |
| Date | When the race took place (format DD.MM.YYYY) |

The format is the same in both data files.

## Questions

Since the birthdate is listed with only two digits for the year, this
is a good opportunity for checking for outliers with graphs and data cleaning.
Also, there are plenty of ways to split-apply-combine the data to practice
with pandas or dplyr operations. For example, find the fastest time achieved
by each country, or examine whether the fastest time in a given year has been
decreasing over time. Is the fastest time correlated with the wind speed? 
Are certain cities more likely to produce fast times?
