## Motivation

Physician Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis (1787â€“1872) provided a now-classic
analysis which helped to debunk the practice of bloodletting.

In his study, Louis investigated records of pneumonia patients. Bloodletting was
so common a medical treatment at the time, every patient Louis investigated had
the bleeding procedure performed on them. But some patients had been given the
bloodletting later in the course of the pneumonia.

Conventional wisdom at the time was that bloodletting was beneficial, so the
patients whose bleeding had been delayed should have fared worse than the
patients who had been given bleeding early in the course of the illness.

## Data

Each row represents one patient in the study. There were 77 total patients.

### Variable descriptions

| Variable | Description |
|----|-------------|
| Age | The age of the pneumonia patient (only available for patients who died) |
| DayFirstBled | The day of the illness when bloodletting was first performed |
| FirstBleeding | A categorical version of `DayFirstBled`, defined as "early" if the day of first bleeding as 1 to 4, "late" if day of first bleeding was 5+ |
| NumBleedings | The total number of bloodlettings performed on the patient |
| SickDays | The total duration (in days) of the illness |
| Outcome | Whether the patient lived or died from the illness|

## Questions

1. One of P.C.A. Louis's analyses compared the survival rates of patients bled
   early to those bled late (`FirstBleeding`). Construct a $2 \times 2$
   contingency table of the outcome (whether the patient lived or died) and
   whether the patient was bled early or late. Calculate the survival rate for
   each group. Interpret your results.
2. Using your contingency table, conducted a $\chi^2$ test of proportions. Is
   the survival rate for each group different? State your null hypothesis, test
   statistic, and *p* value, and interpret your results.
3. Use a logistic regression model to predict the outcome based on the day
   bloodletting was first performed (`DayFirstBled`). State the coefficient and
   give a confidence interval. Do patients have better outcomes if they were
   bled earlier or later?
4. It's reasonable to assume that the number of bleedings also matters. Extend
   your logistic regression to include this (`NumBleedings`) as a covariate.
   Interpret both coefficients.
