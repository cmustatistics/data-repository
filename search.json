    "text": "In the late 1800s and early 1900s, numerous rail lines were built across the United States and connected most towns and cities for passenger and cargo service. But as cars became dominant and the Interstate Highway System made long-distance travel by car easier, rail traffic declined, and many rail lines were shut down or abandoned. Some lines were kept by the railroads for future use, while others were sold off.\nBeginning in the 1980s, some unused rail lines began to be converted to rail trails: walking and biking trails along the route of an old rail line. Rail trails tend to be long continuous trails, often paved, and have gentle slopes at most (because trains cannot climb steep hills). This makes them accessible and easy to bike along.\nSome have suggested that rail trails may be an attractive feature for people buying homes, who might be willing to pay more for a home close to a trail where they could walk or bike for fun or for their commute.\nThis data was collected from houses sold in Northampton, Massachusetts in 2007. A new rail trail was opened in Northampton in 1984, offering an opportunity to compare the values of homes near the trail and farther from the trail. See the References below for more detail on the data collection and the history of rail trails in the area, which provides useful context."

Because there are many varieties within the species, there are many varieties of seed that farmers can choose to plant, and each variety is suited for different growing climates and for different markets.\nHowever, in countries like Turkey, most farmers do not use commercially produced seeds certified to be all of one specific variety.

If seeds can be accurately sorted by computer, a machine could automatically sort seeds at high speed, allowing farmers to sort their crops, pick the best varieties for their fields and their markets, and sell their seeds to other farmers who want a specific variety.\nTo collect this data, researchers used a camera to take photographs of 13,611 beans of seven different varieties. (This study was conducted in Turkey, so the varieties are known by their Turkish names: Barbunya, Battal, Bombay, Calı, Dermason, Horoz, Tombul, Selanik and Seker.) The beans were of known variety. The researchers then used image processing code to extract features from the images, including the bean sizes and several measures of shape.

Also choose your validation strategy carefully to ensure you can estimate your final model’s accuracy.\nExplore different ways to measure the accuracy of the classifier. Examining the confusion matrix may be useful to see what it is doing, but you should also produce useful summaries, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and so on. Choose summaries that would be the most useful to bean producers.\nWhich varieties are easiest to confuse with each other? Which are most obviously different?

What about their cephalothorax width?\nIf the prey lost weight, the male cheated and ate some of the prey before making a gift. Is the weight loss of the prey positively related to the mass of silk used to wrap it into a gift, as we’d expect if the male was hiding an inferior gift? Produce supporting graphs. Does the relationship depend on whether the male was fed the high or low food diet?\n(In three cases, the prey gained weight. According to the researchers, this is “most likely due to spiders’ injection of digestive fluids that serve for liquefying the prey during feeding”.)\nDoes the latency before wrapping the fit correlate with the weight loss of the gift, suggesting males waited longer to wrap inferior gifts (or waited too long and got tempted by the juicy cricket)?\nIs there a difference in the weight loss of the prey between males fed the high food and low food diets? What about in the amount of silk used?\nRegress the total time spent wrapping the gift against the mass of the gift. How many milligrams of silk can the male wrap per second?\nAccording to the researchers, the MALE R BODY INDEX variable was calculated as “the residuals of a regression of body mass on body size (cephalothorax width)”. Perform the regression yourself and try to match your results against the researchers. Does it match?"

We also know that the location (Location), moon phase (% Moon Visible), mean night temperature (Mean Temp), and mean humidity (Mean Humidity) might affect insect activity. Conduct an EDA of these variables to determine what relationships the predictors may have with the response.\nConsider the study design. Because six traps were placed out each night, each with a different bulb (or no bulb), the traps were exposed to the same location, moon phase, temperature, and humidity. No bulb type has data from moon phases that are systematically different from the other bulbs, or was used on nights that were warmer than those for the other bulbs, or anything like that. This is known as a balanced design.\nComment on what this design choice means. Can location, moon phase, mean temperature, or mean humidity be confounding variables that would bias our estimates of the effect of bulb type? Do we need to incorporate them into our models to obtain an unbiased estimate of the causal effect of bulb type?\nObtain the mean number of insects trapped by each bulb. Display the means in a table. Which bulb attracts the fewest insects?\nNote there is one missing count (recorded as NA) that you may need to remove.\nSelect a GLM for the total number of insects collected as a function of bulb type, location, moon phase, temperature, and humidity. Use your EDA to guide your model choice, and produce any necessary diagnostic plots to validate your choice.\nProduce a table of coefficients estimated from your final model, including standard errors. Interpret, in words, the meaning of the coefficient for temperature, giving a 95% confidence interval for the size of the effect.\nConsider a night where the moon is 60% visible, the humidity is 60%, and the mean temperature is 15 °C. (These are roughly the average values in the data.) Produce a table of the predicted number of insects trapped by each bulb type at the La Kretz station on a night like this, giving 95% confidence intervals for each prediction. Does your result match the table from part 3?"

The Rubin Observatory, a sky survey telescope located in Chile, will once it becomes operational image tens of billions of astronomical objects, the vast majority of which will be galaxies that have never been imaged before. Analyses of these data will require sophisticated methodologies, ones that will allow us to first determine where the galaxies are (i.e., how far away they are), and then conditional on the distance, how massive they are. Given galaxy distance and mass data, we can test theories of how the Universe evolves, by comparing simulated galaxy data with these data.\nThe Buzzard-V1.0 simulation was used to generate a realistic sample of Rubin Observatory data. In this dataset are measurements for 111,172 galaxies. Developers used these data to benchmark, e.g., methods for estimating galaxy distance. Here, we can assume the distance has been estimated well, and use these data to try to model galaxy mass as a function of brightness and distance."

    "text": "Data\nThe dataset contains measures of magnitude and magnitude uncertainty in six astronomical bands (u for ultraviolet, g for green, r for red, i for infrared, and z and y for two additional infrared bands). Magnitude is a logarithmic measure of brightness, with an increase of 5 representing a decrease in brightness by a factor of 100, and with a value of zero being represented (roughly) by how the star Vega appears in the night sky. In addition, there is a redshift measured for each galaxy; it represents by how much light from the galaxy is stretched (by the expansion of Universe) as it travels to us. Thus higher redshifts represent larger distances. The last measurement is log.mass, which is the base-10 logarithm of the galaxy stellar mass in units of solar mass; for instance, log.mass = 10 means that the galaxy has a mass 10 billion times that of the Sun.\n\nData preview\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nVariable descriptions\n\nBuzzard_DC1.csv\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nu\nGalaxy magnitude in Rubin u band (320.5-393.5 nm)\n\n\ng\nGalaxy magnitude in Rubin g band (401.5-551.9 nm)\n\n\nr\nGalaxy magnitude in Rubin r band (552.0-691.0 nm)\n\n\ni\nGalaxy magnitude in Rubin i band (691.0-818.0 nm)\n\n\nz\nGalaxy magnitude in Rubin z band (818.0-923.5 nm)\n\n\ny\nGalaxy magnitude in Rubin y band (923.8-1084.5 nm)\n\n\nu.err\nUncertainty for u-band magnitude\n\n\ng.err\nUncertainty for g-band magnitude\n\n\nr.err\nUncertainty for r-band magnitude\n\n\ni.err\nUncertainty for i-band magnitude\n\n\nz.err\nUncertainty for z-band magnitude\n\n\ny.err\nUncertainty for y-band magnitude\n\n\nlog.mass\nGalaxy stellar mass (log-base-10 solar masses)\n\n\nredshift\nGalaxy redshift"

Keep these in mind when you perform your analysis.\nWhich sections attract the most diverse group of authors to each discussion?\nWhat’s the relationship between views and posts? Does it vary by subforum? Are there discussions which have disproportionately more views than they should? Some discussions are prominent for some strange Google query and get loads of visitors.\nSome discussions involve many people over many pages. Some involve the same three people arguing for weeks. Which kind of discussion is more likely to be closed by moderators? Which is more likely to be deleted?\nDo discussions with proportionally more deleted posts tend to get closed more often? There’s a natural confounding effect with the length of the discussion, so be sure to control for this.\nPerhaps some sections have a lower barrier to entry than others. It’s thought that discussions in Speculations are much easier to join—-very little technical background is required to argue with crackpots—-than discussions in physics, chemistry, or other technical sections. Do you see evidence of this in the data?\nAre members who have been registered for longer before starting the topic more successful at starting active discussions?\nModerators would like to know which topics are at greatest risk of needing to be closed. Build a classification model to predict whether a given topic will be closed, using only covariates that would be available while it is active. (Total number of posts wouldn’t be available, for example, but the post rate, number of posts per unique author, or fraction of posts deleted would be.)\nDid discussions tend to be more active in the early years of the forum, or are more recent discussions more active? Consider the effect on post counts and the number of authors.\nThe overall number of posts may vary seasonally for several reasons. Perhaps students post more in the summer, when they have spare time. Alternately, perhaps they post more during the school year, when they have more science questions. Do you see evidence of either trend in the data?"

    "text": "Questions\nSuppose the Assistant Minister of Health is interested in increasing the number of people who get annual health exams. The Ministry could simply send reminders or offer incentives to anyone who does not appear for an exam each year. But the budget is limited and they cannot afford to try to convince every possible patient to get a check-up. Also, the Ministry does not know why people do not sign up for exams, and understanding why could help them make policy changes or make their public relations campaigns more effective. (For example, if people tend to think check-ups are a waste of money, their advertising should emphasize how cheap they are; if people don’t believe medical service is high-quality, the advertising should emphasize the expertise and training of doctors.)\n\nOverall, how do people rate the attractiveness, impressiveness, sufficiency, and popularity of information they receive in checkups? Give summaries of these variables, as well as variables like assurance, reliability, and empathy that indicate how medical personnel may be able to improve.\nBuild a classifier to predict whether the respondent had a check-up in the last 12 months (using RecPerExam). Use predictors that plausibly could be related, and discuss which predictors have the strongest relationship with the outcome. Which make a person less likely to get a check-up every twelve months?\nThe original paper (see citation below) used logistic regression to evaluate how RecPerExam can be predicted by Wsttime, Wstmon, HthyPriority, FlwHealth, and HealthIns. Try to replicate their analysis and evaluate whether logistic regression is a good modeling choice. How do its results compare to your classifier?\nOne plausible hypothesis is that none of these factors matter much unless you have health issues or know someone in their family with health issues. (This is in StabHthStt.) That is, if nobody you know has serious health issues, you may not decide to get check-ups, regardless of how attractive impressive or inexpensive they are. If you do, then the factors do influence your probability of getting a check-up. Test this hypothesis."

Using the full ratings data, build a model that allows ratings to depend both on the person being rated and on the rater, as well as on whether the participant was wearing makeup.

    "text": "Excess consumption of sugary drinks–soda, lemonade, sweet tea, and everything in between–has been blamed for a variety of health problems, like diabetes and obesity, which collectively cause billions of dollars of health costs each year. Some governments are taking action to reduce consumption of sugary drinks; most famously, the New York City Board of Health passed a regulation in 2012 banning the sale of sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces. Naturally there was a backlash, and eventually a court case ruled the board didn’t have the authority to make such a rule.\nRegardless of New York’s legal troubles, and setting aside the question of whether sugary drinks are solely to blame for the health problems they contribute to, we can ask the question “What kinds of regulations or serving suggestions would make people drink smaller amounts?” Perhaps by limiting size, changing serving methods, or with other small changes we could encourage people to drink less without an outright ban.\nResearchers conducted a series of experiments to try different strategies. The dataset here is from one of those experiments.\nParticipants were invited to the lab for 90 minutes, during which they sat in a cubicle and completed surveys and tasks for other unrelated psychological studies. The experimenters provided them a bag of potato chips at the start to make them thirsty, then offered them iced tea or lemonade during the experiment; they were given a small amount of money at the start to use to buy the drinks, and paid per drink.\nThere were two different manipulations.

Analyze the number of calories they consumed, depending on the portion type and type of service. Again, consider including an interaction if it seems necessary.\nThe researchers hypothesized that bundling may reduce consumption, since having drinks in two separate cups makes it easier to realize how much you’re drinking. Is there evidence to support this? Does it seem to matter whether participants had to give their order to an assistant or served themselves?\nRepeat your analysis, this time only including those who did not fail the comprehension check at the end, which checked that they correctly understood their drink options. Are the results consistent?\nThe experiment wasn’t intended for this purpose, but we can conduct a purely exploratory analysis using this data to explore drink preferences. Of those participants who ordered a drink, how many favored Snapple and how many favored lemonade? Do preferences depend on sex, age, or ethnicity? Build a model to predict the flavor of drink a participant ordered. How accurate is it?"

    "text": "Questions\n\nThe original paper measured the diversity of each group using something called “group faultline analysis”, which looks at the group members’ genders, countries of origin, and ethnicities to calculate a diversity score. The calculation is somewhat involved, so we’ll make a simpler score. For each group, calculate the number of unique gender-ethnicity-country combinations (such as female-white-Russia or male-Indian-USA) among the group members, and store this with the other group information such as team size and performance. Also calculate the average testosterone level for each group.\nDo exploratory data analysis to explore the composition of groups, the typical amount of diversity, and the typical amounts of testosterone. Note particularly that the data includes the logs of the cortisol and testosterone levels as well as the raw levels; does your EDA suggest you should use the logs or the raw values?\nThe data also includes participant ages. It’s possible age is related to hormone levels, as is gender, and that both are related to final performance (perhaps older team members have more relevant experience, for example). Consider carefully whether you want to include these variables in the model, and how you should include them—average team member age? Gender proportion?\nBuild a model predicting group performance (final.performance) using the group’s diversity score (be sure to control for the size of the group) and its average testosterone level. Is there an interaction between the two? Do your results resemble those presented by the original study?\nThe dataset also includes cortisol measurements. Cortisol is a hormone with many effects and roles in the body, but is commonly known as a “stress hormone” because its levels often increase because of sleep deprivation, intense exercise, and stress. Curiously, though cortisol is included in the data, it is not mentioned in the paper apart from an appendix. Include it in your analysis. Do stressed groups have better or worse performance? Does stress change the effect of diversity?"

    "text": "Questions\n\nThe simplest question is also the one that directly answers the study’s main question: Did participants given a larger plate eat more, on average, than those given a smaller plate?\nPerhaps the effect of plate size varies depending on impulsivity (measured by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and the Stop Signal Task) or socioeconomic status (measured by income, education, and the Index of Multiple Deprivation). One could imagine, for example, that people who regularly struggle to get enough food might be more affected by the desire to eat everything on their plate. Conduct an analysis to see if the effect of plate size differs depending on these factors.\nThe study was designed to have the sample size needed to get 80% statistical power to detect a difference of d = 0.5 standard deviations in the amount of food consumed between the two groups. The power analysis did not determine the sample size needed to detect if the effect of plate size differs depending on other factors. Use simulation to determine the power of the study to detect such differences. Is it capable of reliably detecting them?"
