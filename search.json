    "text": "Estimating the properties of galaxies, and even where they are, is a challenging process. The Rubin Observatory, a sky survey telescope located in Chile, will once it becomes operational image tens of billions of astronomical objects, the vast majority of which will be galaxies that have never been imaged before. Analyses of these data will require sophisticated methodologies, ones that will allow us to first determine where the galaxies are (i.e., how far away they are), and then conditional on the distance, how massive they are. Given galaxy distance and mass data, we can test theories of how the Universe evolves, by comparing simulated galaxy data with these data.\nThe Buzzard-V1.0 simulation was used to generate a realistic sample of Rubin Observatory data. In this dataset are measurements for 111,172 galaxies. Developers used these data to benchmark, e.g., methods for estimating galaxy distance. Here, we can assume the distance has been estimated well, and use these data to try to model galaxy mass as a function of brightness and distance."

Magnitude is a logarithmic measure of brightness, with an increase of 5 representing a decrease in brightness by a factor of 100, and with a value of zero being represented (roughly) by how the star Vega appears in the night sky. In addition, there is a redshift measured for each galaxy; it represents by how much light from the galaxy is stretched (by the expansion of Universe) as it travels to us. Thus higher redshifts represent larger distances. The last measurement is log.mass, which is the base-10 logarithm of the galaxy stellar mass in units of solar mass; for instance, log.mass = 10 means that the galaxy has a mass 10 billion times that of the Sun.\n\nBuzzard_DC1.csv\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nu\nGalaxy magnitude in Rubin u band (320.5-393.5 nm)\n\n\ng\nGalaxy magnitude in Rubin g band (401.5-551.9 nm)\n\n\nr\nGalaxy magnitude in Rubin r band (552.0-691.0 nm)\n\n\ni\nGalaxy magnitude in Rubin i band (691.0-818.0 nm)\n\n\nz\nGalaxy magnitude in Rubin z band (818.0-923.5 nm)\n\n\ny\nGalaxy magnitude in Rubin y band (923.8-1084.5 nm)\n\n\nu.err\nUncertainty for u-band magnitude\n\n\ng.err\nUncertainty for g-band magnitude\n\n\nr.err\nUncertainty for r-band magnitude\n\n\ni.err\nUncertainty for i-band magnitude\n\n\nz.err\nUncertainty for z-band magnitude\n\n\ny.err\nUncertainty for y-band magnitude\n\n\nlog.mass\nGalaxy stellar mass (log-base-10 solar masses)\n\n\nredshift\nGalaxy redshift"

Because it is unusual, researchers wanted to know if men who wear “subtle cosmetics” would be rated as more attractive by viewers.\nThe basic experiment was simple, as described in the abstract of the paper:\n\nTwenty men were photographed facing forward, under constant camera and lighting conditions, with neutral expressions, and closed mouths. Each man was photographed twice: once without any cosmetics applied and another time with subtle cosmetics applied by a professional makeup artist. Two hundred participants then rated those 40 images on attractiveness.\n\nEach of the 200 raters rated all 40 images, in random order, so they saw each male participant both with and without makeup.

    "text": "Some research has suggested that groups of people working on a task can do better if the group is more diverse, since diverse group members can suggest more creative ideas and make better decisions. At the same time, diverse groups can have more conflict than less diverse groups, possibly eliminating those benefits.\nThis dataset is from a study that attempted to understand these factors and how they relate to the testosterone levels of members of the group. People with high levels of testosterone tend to be competitive and may try to dominate their groups, leading to conflict, while people with low testosterone may be more cooperative. So do groups with low testosterone work better together, and benefit more from diversity, than those with high testosterone?\nThe study involved 370 students working on their Master of Business Administration degrees at Columbia Business School. The students were randomly assigned to groups of three to six people, and their testosterone levels were measured. The groups then did a week-long project where they pretended to run blood-testing laboratories, with the goal of making their laboratories perform better than those run by other groups in the class. Group members had to collaborate with each other to decide on their strategy. At the end of the project, the researchers recorded how well each group’s laboratories did, how much money they made, and so on.\nThe result, according to the study, was that\n\nThe findings suggest that diversity is beneficial for performance, but only if group-level testosterone is low; diversity has a negative effect on performance if group-level testosterone is high."

The calculation is somewhat involved, so we’ll make a simpler score. For each group, calculate the number of unique gender-ethnicity-country combinations (such as female-white-Russia or male-Indian-USA) among the group members, and store this with the other group information such as team size and performance. Also calculate the average testosterone level for each group.\nDo exploratory data analysis to explore the composition of groups, the typical amount of diversity, and the typical amounts of testosterone. Note particularly that the data includes the logs of the cortisol and testosterone levels as well as the raw levels; does your EDA suggest you should use the logs or the raw values?\nThe data also includes participant ages. It’s possible age is related to hormone levels, as is gender, and that both are related to final performance (perhaps older team members have more relevant experience, for example). Consider carefully whether you want to include these variables in the model, and how you should include them—average team member age? Gender proportion?\nBuild a model predicting group performance (final.performance) using the group’s diversity score (be sure to control for the size of the group) and its average testosterone level. Is there an interaction between the two? Do your results resemble those presented by the original study?\nThe dataset also includes cortisol measurements. Cortisol is a hormone with many effects and roles in the body, but is commonly known as a “stress hormone” because its levels often increase because of sleep deprivation, intense exercise, and stress. Curiously, though cortisol is included in the data, it is not mentioned in the paper apart from an appendix. Include it in your analysis. Do stressed groups have better or worse performance? Does stress change the effect of diversity?"

    "text": "Medical care for serious diseases can be very expensive, and in countries without established socialized medical systems it can impose serious hardships on patients. Ideally, patients would get regular check-ups (or “general health examinations”, GHEs) so that serious conditions could be detected and treated early, before they cause serious problems. This would save money and improve public health.\nHowever, there are many possible obstacles to getting everyone to go to regular check-ups. They might be too expensive, or too difficult to schedule; some people may not trust doctors or believe that check-ups have any value; or some people may have had bad experiences when they previously tried to get check-ups.\nPublic health researchers in Vietnam wanted to explore these reasons and determine what obstacles prevented widespread use of regular check-ups. They conducted an interview survey in Hanoi and Hung Yen, Vietnam, by traveling to “secondary schools, hospitals, companies, government agencies and randomly selected households in Hanoi” and interviewing people in person for about 10-15 minutes. This dataset contains the raw data from that survey."

The Ministry could simply send reminders or offer incentives to anyone who does not appear for an exam each year. But the budget is limited and they cannot afford to try to convince every possible patient to get a check-up. Also, the Ministry does not know why people do not sign up for exams, and understanding why could help them make policy changes or make their public relations campaigns more effective. (For example, if people tend to think check-ups are a waste of money, their advertising should emphasize how cheap they are; if people don’t believe medical service is high-quality, the advertising should emphasize the expertise and training of doctors.)\n\nOverall, how do people rate the attractiveness, impressiveness, sufficiency, and popularity of information they receive in checkups? Give summaries of these variables, as well as variables like assurance, reliability, and empathy that indicate how medical personnel may be able to improve.\nBuild a classifier to predict whether the respondent had a check-up in the last 12 months (using RecPerExam). Use predictors that plausibly could be related, and discuss which predictors have the strongest relationship with the outcome. Which make a person less likely to get a check-up every twelve months?\nThe original paper (see citation below) used logistic regression to evaluate how RecPerExam can be predicted by Wsttime, Wstmon, HthyPriority, FlwHealth, and HealthIns. Try to replicate their analysis and evaluate whether logistic regression is a good modeling choice. How do its results compare to your classifier?\nOne plausible hypothesis is that none of these factors matter much unless you have health issues or know someone in their family with health issues. (This is in StabHthStt.) That is, if nobody you know has serious health issues, you may not decide to get check-ups, regardless of how attractive impressive or inexpensive they are. If you do, then the factors do influence your probability of getting a check-up. Test this hypothesis."

    "text": "Our overall goal is to provide a collection of useful, real-world datasets from a variety of application areas that can be used as in-class examples, homework assignments, or course projects. The repository can always use new datasets, so we welcome submissions. Datasets should meet a few requirements:\n\nThe data must be publicly shareable. There should not be any licensing restrictions that prevent us from sharing it, or any human subjects ethics concerns or other limitations. Look for datasets marked as being in the public domain or with licenses like the Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license.\nThe data should be in a standard, easy-to-use format, like CSV. If you have to clean the data from an original form, include the R script you used to clean it with your submission.\nThere should be good motivation for interesting analyses of the data that would be appropriate for a course.\nThe data should be of reasonable size. GitHub does not allow files greater than 100 MB, and large files can be inconvenient for students. Files larger than a few megabytes should be compressed when practical. R (read.csv()) and Python (pandas.read_csv()) can read .csv.gz files directly, so gzip compression is a good choice for larger files.\n\nOnce you’ve identified a dataset, you can download the data description template file (TODO link). This template is a Quarto file; Quarto is much like R Markdown and is supported by recent versions of RStudio. Quarto files can contain R code, just like R Markdown, so your data description can include graphics and tables generated by R code embedded in the file, if you think this would be helpful to illustrate important features of the data. As you fill out the template, you can use RStudio’s “Render” button to see a preview of the finished page.\nThe template asks for:\n\nBasic metadata, such as the statistical methods applicable to the data, a short title, and your name. (All submissions are credited with the name of the submitter.)\nA description of the problem. This should be sufficient to motivate the analysis and help students understand the setting.\nA description of the data and the variables. It should be clear what each row of data represents and what all variables mean. Units of measure should be included whenever possible.\nReferences to the original source. If the source is an academic paper and the data is deposited in a third-party repository (such as Zenodo, Figshare, or Dryad), include references to both the paper and the archived dataset. When available, include the DOIs of the references.\n\nThe template is meant to prevent a common problem with course datasets: they get passed down from instructor to instructor, and eventually all information about the original source is lost. The dataset may be presented to students without context or important details (like units), and the instructor may not be able to find the original data or references to answer questions about the data.\nOnce you’ve filled in the template, you can email the template file, the data, and any cleaning scripts to TODO. Alternately, submit a pull request to our repository on GitHub (TODO link)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "You’ve probably seen that insects seem to be attracted to artificial lights at night. Insects appear to be most attractive to blue and ultraviolet light, and less attracted by red or infrared light.\nPreviously, most outdoor high-intensity lighting—such as for street lights and parking lots—used sodium vapor lamps, a type of lamp that is very efficient for large lights but also produces a characteristic orange glow. Many cities and countries, however, are moving towards using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in outdoor lighting, since they have become affordable and highly efficient. LED lights promise to require less maintenance and cost less to operate. Also, they are not limited to the orange glow of sodium vapor lamps—they can produce whiter light. Some research suggests this is beneficial for safety, since whiter light makes roads and sidewalks easier to see. But it can also have some harms.\nOne possible harmful effect is to insects. If LEDs can produce whiter or bluer light, they may be more attractive to insects at night, disrupting their circadian rhythms and potentially even leading to their deaths as they circle lights endlessly.\nThis data comes from a study intended to understand how what lights attract insects and what types of insects are most affected, to study the problem. The researchers set up light traps: each trap contained a light bulb and captured any insect attracted by the light to enter the trap.\nThe researchers conducted their experiment by setting up six light traps, each with a different light bulb. (One trap contained no bulb, as a control.) The traps were set up each evening at sunset and then checked in the morning after sunrise, and the insects collected identified and counted.\nTraps were set up at three different sites (one urban, two rural). Relevant weather conditions were recorded. The experiment was repeated 32 times: 16 times at the urban site and 8 times at each rural site. This allowed the researchers to rotate which location (within an individual site) each trap was placed in, and allowed them to collect data under varying weather and moon phases. (Since the moon is bright in the night sky, the presence of a bright moon could presumably affect the results.)"

    "section": "Questions",
    "text": "Questions\nThese are adapted from questions used in notes for 36-707.\n\nWe are interested in the total number of insects collected in each trap (the Total variable) and how it relates to the light bulb type (Light Type). We also know that the location (Location), moon phase (% Moon Visible), mean night temperature (Mean Temp), and mean humidity (Mean Humidity) might affect insect activity. Conduct an EDA of these variables to determine what relationships the predictors may have with the response.\nConsider the study design. Because six traps were placed out each night, each with a different bulb (or no bulb), the traps were exposed to the same location, moon phase, temperature, and humidity. No bulb type has data from moon phases that are systematically different from the other bulbs, or was used on nights that were warmer than those for the other bulbs, or anything like that. This is known as a balanced design.\nComment on what this design choice means. Can location, moon phase, mean temperature, or mean humidity be confounding variables that would bias our estimates of the effect of bulb type? Do we need to incorporate them into our models to obtain an unbiased estimate of the causal effect of bulb type?\nObtain the mean number of insects trapped by each bulb. Display the means in a table. Which bulb attracts the fewest insects?\nNote there is one missing count (recorded as NA) that you may need to remove.\nSelect a GLM for the total number of insects collected as a function of bulb type, location, moon phase, temperature, and humidity. Use your EDA to guide your model choice, and produce any necessary diagnostic plots to validate your choice.\nProduce a table of coefficients estimated from your final model, including standard errors. Interpret, in words, the meaning of the coefficient for temperature, giving a 95% confidence interval for the size of the effect.\nConsider a night where the moon is 60% visible, the humidity is 60%, and the mean temperature is 15 °C. (These are roughly the average values in the data.) Produce a table of the predicted number of insects trapped by each bulb type at the La Kretz station on a night like this, giving 95% confidence intervals for each prediction. Does your result match the table from part 3?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Ecologists and evolutionary biologists have long investigated links between diversity and geography. For example, as the area of a habitat increases, the number of different species found within it increases—a seemingly obvious finding, but the exact shape of the relationship has been found to relate to the rates of immigration and extinction in the habitat, predator-prey behaviors, and so on.\nA similar relationship would seem likely to exist within a species. A species that lives over a small area might have low genetic diversity, because individuals frequently interbreed and there is little opportunity for some individuals to evolve separately from others. A species that lives over a wide area might have high genetic diversity, both because the varied habitat in which it lives means different individuals experience different natural selection pressures, and because individuals far apart may never be able to interbreed.\nThe exact nature of this relationship could be used to test hypotheses about evolution and natural selection. This dataset comes from a paper that explored the relationship in birds, which have widely varying geographic ranges and hence could be a good group to work with."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is a plant widely cultivated for its dry seeds—beans. The species has long been cultivated for food and has developed into many varieties; many common beans, such as kidney beans, pinto beans, navy beans, and wax beans, are all varieties of the common bean. Because there are many varieties within the species, there are many varieties of seed that farmers can choose to plant, and each variety is suited for different growing climates and for different markets.\nHowever, in countries like Turkey, most farmers do not use commercially produced seeds certified to be all of one specific variety. They use seeds they obtain from their own crops or from other farmers, which may contain many different varieties of bean. To sort out specific varieties would require a trained expert to carefully sort the beans—which would be quite difficult when planting a field takes many thousands of seeds!\nAs a result, there is some demand for systems that can automatically classify seeds by variety, for example by using images of the seeds. If seeds can be accurately sorted by computer, a machine could automatically sort seeds at high speed, allowing farmers to sort their crops, pick the best varieties for their fields and their markets, and sell their seeds to other farmers who want a specific variety.\nTo collect this data, researchers used a camera to take photographs of 13,611 beans of seven different varieties. (This study was conducted in Turkey, so the varieties are known by their Turkish names: Barbunya, Battal, Bombay, Calı, Dermason, Horoz, Tombul, Selanik and Seker.) The beans were of known variety. The researchers then used image processing code to extract features from the images, including the bean sizes and several measures of shape. The goal was to use these features to classify the variety of the beans; if this is possible, one could build a system using a camera and computer to automatically classify beans by variety."
