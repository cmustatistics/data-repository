Regress heterozygosity against breeding range size, body mass, and latitude. Examine the shape of the relationship, which is thought not to be linear and suspected to have an asymptote. Does the relationship depend on whether the species are migratory? Compare this to the shape you find using allelic richness instead of heterozygosity as the outcome.\nSpecies in this dataset are grouped into families; by definitions, species within a family are more similar than species in two different families. This may have effects on the assumptions of the regression. What assumptions may be violated, and what effect would this have on your results? (Note that the original paper accounted for this effect by taking into account the species’ phylogenetic trees.)\nFit a hierarchical model to account for this effect, using family to define the hierarchy.

Is the weight loss of the prey positively related to the mass of silk used to wrap it into a gift, as we’d expect if the male was hiding an inferior gift? Produce supporting graphs. Does the relationship depend on whether the male was fed the high or low food diet?\n(In three cases, the prey gained weight. According to the researchers, this is “most likely due to spiders’ injection of digestive fluids that serve for liquefying the prey during feeding”.)\nDoes the latency before wrapping the fit correlate with the weight loss of the gift, suggesting males waited longer to wrap inferior gifts (or waited too long and got tempted by the juicy cricket)?\nIs there a difference in the weight loss of the prey between males fed the high food and low food diets? What about in the amount of silk used?\nRegress the total time spent wrapping the gift against the mass of the gift. How many milligrams of silk can the male wrap per second?\nAccording to the researchers, the MALE R BODY INDEX variable was calculated as “the residuals of a regression of body mass on body size (cephalothorax width)”.

    "text": "Questions\n\nConduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), using maps and scatterplots to explore relationships in the data. Also examine the distribution of key variables, such as county population—how will its distribution affect your analysis?\nThe first question studied in the research was “whether white population decline or manufacturing loss predicted county-level insurrectionists”:\n\nThe theory is straightforward: long-term manufacturing job loss in a community makes it more likely that some people within that county will face economic insecurity and become more likely to not only vote for populist political candidates but also to become violent supporters of them. In the case of Jan 6, the greater the local decline in manufacturing and associated loss in manufacturing income, the deeper is the commitment to Trump as the most likely leader to bring prosperity back to their communities and the greater was the willingness to use extra-democratic and even violent means to retain him in power will have been. If counties with more manufacturing decline were associated with higher rates of arrested insurrectionists, it would be consistent with the economic mechanism.\n\nConduct an analysis to test this theory. Be sure to account for county population: more populous counties may send more insurrectionists due to their size, even in the same economic conditions. Distance from Washington, D.C., is also a factor, as it is more difficult for people farther from Washington to travel there even if they would like to do so.\nThe original analysis used a negative binomial regression with a log link (similar to a Poisson GLM with a log link). To control for county population, the authors added it as a control variable. Write out the regression equation and derive the relationship between the number of insurrectionists per unit population and the population size. Does including population as a control correctly model the rate? If not, what transformation is required?",

It is often viewed as a proxy for gender bias in film and TV. Using a movie dataset from 1970 to 2013, we try to understand if passing the Bechdel test hurts or benefits the box office.\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 29, 2025\n\n\nJessica Zhiyu Guo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBias in soccer refereeing\n\n\nAre dark-skinned soccer players more likely to receive red cards than those with light skin?

But very little public data has been available on university admissions practices. This dataset, collected by Opportunity Insights, gives extensive detail on college application and admission rates for 139 colleges and universities across the United States, including data on the incomes of students. How do admissions practices vary by institution, and are wealthy students overrepresented?\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 8, 2023\n\n\nJessica Zhiyu Guo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropean protected ham\n\n\nIn Europe, some types of ham—like Black Forest ham—can only be legally produced in specific geographic regions. Does the size of those regions affect the price of the ham?\n\n\n\n\n\nJun 9, 2023\n\n\nAlex Reinhart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFandango movie ratings\n\n\nWhich site do you use for movie ratings?

This study had participants rate photos of men with and without makeup on.\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 4, 2022\n\n\nAlex Reinhart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMapping Police Violence\n\n\nEach year in the United States, around 1,000 people are killed by police. Some of these deaths are accidental, in traffic accidents and other incidents; some are deliberate killings considered legally justified by authorities; and others are considered unjustified or even lead to the prosecution of the police officer. Explore data on over 10,000 such killings to identify patterns in the people killed, the stated reasons for their killings, and the situations leading to their deaths.\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 6, 2023\n\n\nJessica Zhiyu Guo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNightly sleep time and GPA in first-years\n\n\nDoes nightly sleep duration predict change in end-of-semester grade point average (GPA)?

Each dataset is supported by a story describing its origin and application, and a set of interesting questions that can be answered using the data. This means:\n\nEvery dataset has context in a scientific field, pop culture, or daily life.\nBeyond context, datasets are interesting. They feature more than just a dozen observations from an antiquated scientific study — many feature thousands of observations of dozens of variables, and answer questions interesting to a wide audience.\nJust like in science, some datasets give null results.\nInstructors can easily build lessons and assignments from the suggested questions.\n\nDatasets are organized by broad subject areas on the left, or you can browse a sortable list of all datasets."

    "text": "Data\nThe Human-AI Parallel English Corpus (HAP-E) is based on 12,000 original texts, scraped from various online sources. There are 2,000 texts from each of six different text-types:\n\nAcademic writing from a corpus of open-access academic papers published by Elsevier\nNews from a corpus of online news articles published by US-based news organizations\nFiction from novels and short stories in the public domain and available on Project Gutenberg (which hosts work that is out-of-copyright, so typically from before the 1930s)\nSpoken word from a corpus of podcast transcriptions\nBlog posts from a corpus of posts from blogger.com\nTV/movie scripts drawn from two corpora of scripts\n\nTwo chunks were extracted from each text. The first chunk of approximately 500 words was used to prompt the LLMs, by asking them to write the next 500 words in the same style. The second chunk of 500 words was compared to the version written by the LLMs. There were six LLMs used:\n\n\n\nLLM\nVersion\nInstruction-tuned?\n\n\n\n\nGPT-4o Mini\n2024-07-18\nYes\n\n\nGPT-4o\n2024-08-06\nYes\n\n\nLlama 3\n8B\nNo\n\n\nLlama 3\n8B Instruct\nYes\n\n\nLlama 3\n70B\nNo\n\n\nLlama 3\n70B Instruct\nYes\n\n\n\nGPT-4o Mini and Llama 3 8B are smaller models with fewer parameters; GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B are larger and more capable.\nOccasionally the LLMs refused to complete the writing task, for instance if the text was violent or sexually explicit, or generated very short output. Short outputs were filtered out and only texts where all LLMs provided output were kept, leaving \\(n = 8290\\) texts.\nEach chunk—the human first and second chunk and the 500-word chunks generated by the LLMs—was then analyzed with the pseudobibeR package, which calculates the rate of 66 different rhetorical features in the texts. These are the variables provided in the data, listed below.\nEach row of data represents one 500-word chunk of text. As there were 8,290 texts, each with two human chunks and six LLM chunks, there are \\(8290 \\times 8 =\n66320\\) rows.\n\nData preview\n\n hap-e-biber.csv.gz \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable descriptions\n\nMetadata\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ndoc_id\nDocument ID of the text, in the format texttype_id.

    "text": "Data\nThere were a total of 634 participants in this study, who each received a Fitbit to track their sleep and physical activity. Students’ GPAs were collected from the university registrar. Each data row represents one participant.\nUsing the Fitbit data, the researchers extracted sleep “episodes”, which are simply time periods where the Fitbit reported the participant as sleeping. They only counted episodes at least 20 minutes long, separated by at least 5 minutes from other episodes. Gaps smaller than 5 minutes were ignored, so if a student slept for several hours, woke for a few minutes, and then slept again, this was counted as a single episode.\nThe longest sleep episode between noon of one day and noon of the next was considered the “main” episode; anything else was considered “daytime sleep”. For example, if a student slept from 4pm to 5pm, then again from 2am to 8am, the 2-8am window was the “main” episode (6 hours long), and the 4-5pm window was counted as 1 hour of daytime sleep. The beginning of the main episode was counted as the student’s “bedtime”, so in this example, the student’s bedtime was 2am.\nThe data is divided into five separate studies, by university and semester:\n\n\n\nStudy\nUniversity\nSemester\n\n\n\n\n1\nCarnegie Mellon University\nSpring 2018\n\n\n2\nUniversity of Washington\nSpring 2018\n\n\n3\nUniversity of Washington\nSpring 2019\n\n\n4\nNotre Dame University\nSpring 2016\n\n\n5\nCarnegie Mellon University\nSpring 2017\n\n\n\n\nData preview\n\n cmu-sleep.csv \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nsubject_id\nUnique ID of the subject\n\n\nstudy\nStudy number, as shown in the table above\n\n\ncohort\nCodename of the cohort that the subject belongs to\n\n\ndemo_race\nBinary label for underrepresented and non-underrepresented students (underrepresented = 0, non-underpresented = 1).

Students were considered first-generation if neither parent completed any college (i.e., high school diploma or less)\n\n\nbedtime_mssd\nMean successive squared difference of bedtime. This measures bedtime variability, and is calculated as the average of the squared difference of bedtime on consecutive nights. For example, if we had four successive nights of sleep, we calculated bedtime MSSD by computing the average of (night 2 bedtime – night 1 bedtime)^2, (night 3 bedtime – night 2 bedtime)^2, and (night 4 bedtime – night 3 bedtime)^2. Times are in units of hours. Compared to calculating standard deviation, this looks at change from day to day, not change relative to an overall mean\n\n\nTotalSleepTime\nAverage time in bed (the difference between wake time and bedtime) minus the length of total awake/restlessness in the main sleep episode, in minutes\n\n\nmidpoint_sleep\nAverage midpoint of bedtime and wake time, in minutes after 11 pm (for example, 364 is 5:04 am)\n\n\nfrac_nights_with_data\nFraction of nights with captured data for the subject. (Some students may not have worn their Fitbits every night, or the battery may have died.)\n\n\ndaytime_sleep\nAverage sleep time outside of the range of the main sleep episode, including short naps or sleep that occurred during the daytime, in minutes\n\n\ncum_gpa\nCumulative GPA (out of 4.0), for semesters before the one being studied. (Since these students are first-years during their spring semester, this is usually just their fall GPA. UW has quarters, so this includes both fall and winter quarters at UW.)\n\n\nterm_gpa\nEnd-of-term GPA (out of 4.0) for the semester being studied\n\n\nterm_units\nNumber of course units carried in the term\n\n\nZterm_units_ZofZ\nBecause each university counts units differently, each student’s units were Z-scored relative to the mean and standard deviation of all students in their study cohort. This score represented the student’s load relative to the average amount of units. The Z-scores for the cohorts were then combined and Z-scored again. 0 represents an average load, while positive values are above-average loads and negative values are below average.",

One could imagine, for example, that people who regularly struggle to get enough food might be more affected by the desire to eat everything on their plate. Conduct an analysis to see if the effect of plate size differs depending on these factors.\nThe study was designed to have the sample size needed to get 80% statistical power to detect a difference of d = 0.5 standard deviations in the amount of food consumed between the two groups. The power analysis did not determine the sample size needed to detect if the effect of plate size differs depending on other factors. Use simulation to determine the power of the study to detect such differences. Is it capable of reliably detecting them?",

    "text": "In 2008, three psychologists published a paper in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology about “moral rebels”: people who, despite being under pressure to conform, instead rebel to do what they think is morally right. Consider Frank Serpico, for example, a New York Police Department officer in the 1960s and early 70s who, aware many fellow officers were corrupt, finally spoke out and brought evidence to the New York Times, leading to reform; or Oskar Schindler, a Nazi Party member who nonetheless worked to save the lives of 1,200 Jewish workers during the Holocaust.\nThe psychologists observed that moral rebels, though widely admired by outsiders, are often not well-appreciated by their peers who were involved in the activities they rebelled against. (Frank Serpico, for example, was shot, possibly in a set-up by other police officers.) They hypothesized that peers of moral rebels feel threatened: accepting the rebel would mean admitting their own behavior was wrong, and it is easier to condemn the rebel than to admit you have done wrong.\nThe psychologists performed several experiments to test their hypothesis. We’re interested in experiment 4, which tested the hypothesis that self-affirmation—performing some activity to make you feel good about yourself—would make it easier to accept the rebel. Their experiment found evidence for this hypothesis.\nHere’s the experiment. Participants (undergraduate students) were assigned to one of three experimental conditions: obedient, rebel control, or rebel self-affirmation. They were then asked to imagine that a burglary had just occurred, and they were then given three photographs of potential suspects, along with descriptions of each suspect. The participants, on the basis of the photographs and descriptions, were supposed to choose which suspect was most likely the burglar, and fill out a form indicating why they made this choice.\nTwo of the photographs depicted white men. The third was “Steven Jones”, an African American man, whose description indicated he had a previous criminal record and no alibi—the descriptions were designed to make him the most likely suspect.\nAfter making the choice and filling out the form, participants were shown a form purportedly from someone else who participated in the study (though it was actually prepared by the experimenters). Those in the “obedient” condition were shown a form picking Steven Jones as the burglar. Those in both “rebel” conditions were shown a form by someone stating “I refuse to make a choice here” on the grounds that it’s “offensive to make a black man the obvious suspect”. Participants were then asked a series of questions about the other participant whose form they viewed.\nThe crucial difference was between the “rebel control” and the “rebel self-affirmation” groups. Participants in the “rebel self-affirmation”, between filling in their own form and viewing the fake form, were asked to write a short essay about “a recent experience in which you demonstrated a quality of value that is very important to you and which made you feel good about yourself.” Participants in the other two groups, as a placebo, were just asked to describe what they had eaten in the past two days.\nThis dataset presents the results of a replication of this experiment, conducted as part of the Reproducibility Project: Psychology, a massive project to redo experiments from 100 different papers from psychological journals, to determine if their results hold up when tested again. Our goal is to see if the self-affirmation task made participants feel better about the rebel than those in the control group.",

What kinds of conclusions could we draw from the results, and what limitations would there be on our ability to draw causal conclusions?\nPlot the distribution of core temperatures during surgery (TWATemp). Comment on the shape of the distribution and find the median.\nSplit the patients into two groups: those with temperatures above the median, and those with temperatures below the median. Calculate the proportion of patients in each group who had serious infections (SeriousInfection), and test whether there is a statistically significant difference.\nCompare these groups in other ways. Do they have different baseline health characteristics, such as age, BMI, and problems like liver or heart disease?\n\n\n\nAdvanced regression\n\nFit a logistic regression model to predict serious post-operative infections (SeriousInfection) as a function of core temperature during surgery (TWATemp). Interpret the results of this fit.\nExtend your model to control for the covariates used in the original study: “age, sex, body-mass index, smoking status, Charlson score, duration of surgery, open (vs. laparoscopic), preoperative steroid usage, immunosuppressive drug usage,” and presence of heart failure, vascular disease, diabetes, renal failure, metastatic cancer, solid tumor, coagulopathy, weight loss, fluid and electrolyte disorders, blood loss anemia, deficiency anemia, and drug use. Interpret the results of this model, and compare it to the previous fit. What can you conclude about core temperature during surgery?\nRepeat this logistic regression, but to predict superficial infection instead of serious infection (SuperficialInfection). Comment on your results and compare them to the results for serious infection.\n\n\n\nSurvival analysis\n\nSplit the patients into two groups: those with surgical core temperatures above the median, and those with temperatures below the median (using TWATemp). Plot estimated survival curves for the length of time the patient spent in the hospital after surgery (DurationHosp). Patients who died in the hospital are censored; the original study analyzed them as follows:\n\nThe patients who died before hospital discharge were considered as never having the event and assigned a censoring time using the observed longest duration among those discharged alive.\n\nInterpret your survival curves in the context of the problem. Which group appears to spend longer in the hospital?\nUse a Cox proportional hazard model to study the association between core temperature during surgery (TWATemp) and time spent in the hospital after surgery (DurationHosp). Control for the confounding variables listed above (for the logistic regression analysis). Interpret your results.",

    "text": "Questions\nSuppose the Assistant Minister of Health is interested in increasing the number of people who get annual health exams. The Ministry could simply send reminders or offer incentives to anyone who does not appear for an exam each year. But the budget is limited and they cannot afford to try to convince every possible patient to get a check-up. Also, the Ministry does not know why people do not sign up for exams, and understanding why could help them make policy changes or make their public relations campaigns more effective. (For example, if people tend to think check-ups are a waste of money, their advertising should emphasize how cheap they are; if people don’t believe medical service is high-quality, the advertising should emphasize the expertise and training of doctors.)\n\nOverall, how do people rate the attractiveness, impressiveness, sufficiency, and popularity of information they receive in checkups? Give summaries of these variables, as well as variables like assurance, reliability, and empathy that indicate how medical personnel may be able to improve.\nBuild a classifier to predict whether the respondent had a check-up in the last 12 months (using RecPerExam). Use predictors that plausibly could be related, and discuss which predictors have the strongest relationship with the outcome. Which make a person less likely to get a check-up every twelve months?\nThe original paper (see citation below) used logistic regression to evaluate how RecPerExam can be predicted by Wsttime, Wstmon, HthyPriority, FlwHealth, and HealthIns. Try to replicate their analysis and evaluate whether logistic regression is a good modeling choice. How do its results compare to your classifier?\nOne plausible hypothesis is that none of these factors matter much unless you have health issues or know someone in their family with health issues. (This is in StabHthStt.) That is, if nobody you know has serious health issues, you may not decide to get check-ups, regardless of how attractive impressive or inexpensive they are. If you do, then the factors do influence your probability of getting a check-up. Test this hypothesis.",

Explore these questions, and others that seem interesting in the data, with charts and graphs.\nBuild a model to predict earnings of students after graduation (MD_EARN_WNE_P10) using incoming test scores, the type of school (public or private), total enrollment, net costs, and debt load. Do more expensive schools seem to pay off — that is, result in higher earnings — when controlling for the scores of the entering students? Is this relationship the same between public and private schools?\nPrivate for-profit schools have been widely criticized for delivering poor educations with high tuition rates, leading students to frequently default on their debts. Are repayment rates (RPY_3YR_RT_SUPP) significantly different between public, private non-profit, and private for-profit schools? What about median earnings?\nDevise a single “score”, which you can calculate using the data available, which measures the “cost-effectiveness” of each school, in terms of the earnings graduates get, adjusted for their incoming test scores, versus the price, debt rates, and financial aid amounts. You can calculate this score in any way that seems reasonable to you. Test it out by ranking the top ten or twenty most cost-effective schools, and see if the results seem reasonable.",

    "text": "Data\nThe data has been aggregated by university and by parental income level, grouped into 13 income brackets. The income brackets are grouped by percentile relative to the US national income distribution, so for instance the 75.0 bin represents parents whose incomes are between the 70th and 80th percentile. The top two bins overlap: the 99.4 bin represents parents between the 99 and 99.9th percentiles, while the 99.5 bin represents parents in the top 1%.\nEach row represents students’ admission and matriculation outcomes from one income bracket at a given university. There are 139 colleges covered in this dataset.\nThe variables include an array of different college-level-income-binned estimates for things including attendance rate (both raw and reweighted by SAT/ACT scores), application rate, and relative attendance rate conditional on application, also with respect to specific test score bands for each college and in/out-of state. Colleges are categorized into six tiers: Ivy Plus, other elite schools (public and private), highly selective public/private, and selective public/private, with selectivity generally in descending order. It also notes whether a college is public and/or flagship, where “flagship” means public flagship universities. Furthermore, they also report the relative application rate for each income bin within specific test bands, which are 50-point bands that had the most attendees in each school tier/category.\nSeveral values are reported in “test-score-reweighted” form. These values control for SAT score: they are calculated separately for each SAT score value, then averaged with weights based on the distribution of SAT scores at the institution.\nNote that since private schools typically don’t differentiate between in-state and out-of-state applications, they largely have any estimate related to that as missing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional education data\n\n\n\nThe College Scorecard dataset contains additional information on universities across the United States. It can be linked to this data by OPEID, a unique 6-digit identifier for each institution.

Which school(s) have the highest top 0.1% and top 1% relative application and attendance rates? Are these results surprising?\nThe researchers define the middle class students as “individuals with parental income between the 70th and 80th percentile of the national parental income distribution.” Based on this characterization, can you visualize the difference in relative application and attendance rate for both the middle class and the top 1% students, by college tiers?\nRecently, 17 schools (Brown, CalTech, UChicago, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Duke, Emory, Georgetown, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Notre Dame, Northwestern, UPenn, Rice, Vanderbilt, and Yale) were sued in a class action lawsuit accused of conspiring to limit financial aid for admitted students. Use relative attendance conditional on application as an outcome, do these 17 schools differ than other comparable private colleges, particularly in low-income (bottom 40%) and middle-class (70-80 percentile) brackets? Use your own discretion to find comparable colleges within the dataset and articulate your reasoning.",

Explore these questions, and others that seem interesting in the data, with charts and graphs.\nOne main question we would like to explore is that whether the demographic composition of the locality affects the occurrences of police violence. We can use the Census data to provide information on 7 groups (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Native, non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders, non-Hispanic two or more races, and Hispanic) in each county. Build a model predicting the count of police violence in each county in the dataset based on their racial/ethnic minority percentage and other factors you think might be relevant. What does the result suggest?\nAnother argument people often make is that officers responsible for police violence against minorities often bear no consequences for their actions. Based on this data, build a logistic model to predict the likelihood of the police officer(s) responsible being charged with all factors you think might be relevant. What does the result suggest?\nSome people suggest that signs of mental health issues and/or drug use might also affect how police respond to a person, say we categorize any mentioning of a gunshot in the cause of death as an indicator for a higher level of force used. Does the data seem to support this claim?\nSimilarly, does the perception of the individual being armed appear to influence the extent of force employed by the police?",

What types of stop are most likely to lead to a ticket?\nOne way to look for racial discrimination in the decision to search a vehicle is called the “outcome test”. If officers do not discriminate, and instead use only objective evidence to decide a car should be searched for drugs, then the rate at which they find drugs should be the same across racial groups. But if officers unfairly target a racial group for searches, they may conduct more searches of drivers in that group without finding any drugs.\nBuild a model to predict whether contraband is found after a search is conducted, using race and other appropriate covariates. Does the outcome test appear to show discrimination? Carefully explain the caveats of your results, discussing confounding variables and mentioning other types of data you would like to have.\nIs there any evidence that traffic stops are most common certain times of year or on certain days of the week? Before conducting your analysis, make some hypotheses about what you expect to find. (Do you think officers would be less likely to make traffic stops in the cold winter months, for example?)",

    "text": "Questions\n\nPerform an exploratory data analysis on this dataset. What is the relationship between house value and pollution? Which variables appear associated with house value?\nPretend the variables are not problematic for now and predict median housing price from the variables given. Be sure to set aside a test set for performance evaluation. What do you see?\nRemove B and LSTAT and build the prediction model again. Does the performance decrease or increase?\nThe original paper by Harrison and Rubinfeld assumes that the proportion of Black residents and the social class of residents impacts housing prices, but provided limited justification. Above we saw the performance difference between including and not including these two variables, but fairness research provides more metrics to assess fairness. Group parity is considered one of the most important notions of fairness in research. Mathematically, it is defined as \\(\\mathbb{E}[h(X) \\mid Y=y, A=a] = \\mathbb{E}[h(X) \\mid Y=y]\\) where \\(A\\) indicates a sensitive attribute like race or gender, and \\(h(X)\\) could be any prediction function.\nLet’s simplify this problem by transforming B, LSTAT, and MEDV into binary variables. Namely, we can code LSTAT and MEDV as 1 when the value exceeds the column median, otherwise 0. We can code B as 1 when the value is above 136.9, where the authors claim the variable begins to have a negative impact on housing price.\nNow the classification task is classifying housing prices as above or below the median, using all other features. Use the transformed versions of B and LSTAT as described above, and remember to keep a test set aside.\nCalculate the demographic parity difference between groups A and B using your test set data. This metric measures the absolute difference in selection rates between the two groups, where the selection rate for each group is the proportion of positive predictions (houses predicted as above median price) within that group. Specifically, you’ll compute:\nGroup A selection rate = (positive predictions in group A) / (total samples in group A)\nGroup B selection rate = (positive predictions in group B) / (total samples in group B)\nDemographic parity difference = |Group A selection rate - Group B selection rate|\nThis tells you whether your model predicts ‘above median price’ at similar rates for both groups, which is important for fairness. What is the group parity difference you find and how would you interpret it? What alternative variables would you include or not include?",

It’s important that the treatment groups and placebo groups are “balanced”. Do you have evidence they are balanced across observable demographic characteristics?\nHaving read the motivations and survey questions, come up with some research questions. For example, “What is the overall effect of the treatment arms on a respondent’s likelihood of responding ‘bad’ to the statement, ‘Migrants live in your country’ (q22r1)?”. How would you model these research questions?\nRun your model from question 2. What do you conclude?\nHow do your results change if you control for respondent heterogeneity, such as gender and age?\nLook at pages 45-46 in the original ABWMLAC study. Do the authors make modeling choices that you didn’t consider? Do you agree with these differences?\nCan you replicate the results in Tables 3.1 (for Mexico) or 3.3 (for the DR) in the original ABWMLAC study?\nSuppose you want to compare the effects of the treatment groups between the countries of Mexico and the Dominican Republic. For example, “Is there a significant difference between Mexico and the DR with regards to the effect of the informative video on a respondent’s likelihood of responding ‘bad’ to q22r1?”. How would you test this?",

    "text": "Questions\n\nDo some basic EDA. Are there any major outliers? Keep these in mind when you perform your analysis.\nWhich sections attract the most diverse group of authors to each discussion?\nWhat’s the relationship between views and posts? Does it vary by subforum? Are there discussions which have disproportionately more views than they should? Some discussions are prominent for some strange Google query and get loads of visitors.\nSome discussions involve many people over many pages. Some involve the same three people arguing for weeks. Which kind of discussion is more likely to be closed by moderators? Which is more likely to be deleted?\nDo discussions with proportionally more deleted posts tend to get closed more often? There’s a natural confounding effect with the length of the discussion, so be sure to control for this.\nPerhaps some sections have a lower barrier to entry than others. It’s thought that discussions in Speculations are much easier to join—-very little technical background is required to argue with crackpots—-than discussions in physics, chemistry, or other technical sections. Do you see evidence of this in the data?\nAre members who have been registered for longer before starting the topic more successful at starting active discussions?\nModerators would like to know which topics are at greatest risk of needing to be closed. Build a classification model to predict whether a given topic will be closed, using only covariates that would be available while it is active. (Total number of posts wouldn’t be available, for example, but the post rate, number of posts per unique author, or fraction of posts deleted would be.)\nDid discussions tend to be more active in the early years of the forum, or are more recent discussions more active? Consider the effect on post counts and the number of authors.\nThe overall number of posts may vary seasonally for several reasons. Perhaps students post more in the summer, when they have spare time. Alternately, perhaps they post more during the school year, when they have more science questions. Do you see evidence of either trend in the data?",

    "text": "Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. It is often caused by infections with viruses or bacteria, and if left untreated, can cause serious harm to the brain and nervous system. Doctors hence treat it as an emergency and seek to immediately start treatment.\nHowever, treating meningitis successfully requires knowing the cause of the infection. Bacterial meningitis, caused by infection with various kinds of bacteria, can be treated with appropriate antibiotics. But viral meningitis, which can be caused by several different kinds of virus, does not respond at all to antibiotics. It’s common to immediately give antibiotics so treatment can start before the cause is definitively known. Doctors then use a lumbar puncture to draw a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the fluid surrounding the brain and spine, to test for signs of bacteria. There are several diagnostic signs:\n\nGram staining: The sample is stained using crystal violet, which binds to the walls of some kinds of bacteria. They hence show up in bright violet under a microscope, demonstrating the presence of gram-positive bacteria. However, other kinds of bacteria (gram-negative bacteria) do not show up with this test, and it may be negative if the patient already received antibiotics.\nWhite blood cell count: White blood cells are the body’s immune cells. A high count indicates response to an infection. There are several kinds of white blood cell: Leukocytes suggest a viral infection, while neutrophil suggests a bacterial infection.\nGlucose level: The cerebrospinal fluid usually has a lower glucose level than the blood. In bacterial meningitis it drops even lower.\nProtein levels: Protein levels are typically higher in bacterial infections than viral.\n\nThese measurements are fairly fast and easy to get from a CSF sample, but are not definitive. To definitively show a bacterium is present, it must be cultured over several days, or antigens detected in a counterimmunoelectrophoresis test. To definitively prove viral meningitis, the virus must be isolated from blood, stool, or CSF samples, or all other causes must be ruled out. In either case, a definitive ruling takes much more time and effort, while a bacterial infection must be treated straight away. So can we accurately decide whether a patient has bacterial meningitis using just the fast and easy-to-obtain test results?",

It is thought that the ratio is a better predictor than the CSF glucose level alone.\nNumber of months from August. (For example, September and July are both 1 month from August.) Bacterial meningitis is most common in the winter and viral meningitis most common in the summer.\n\nConduct an exploratory data analysis. First, examine the amount of missingness of the key variables. Then construct plots to examine how each key variable, including the new ones you calculated, may be related to the response (whether the patient has bacterial meningitis). The researchers believe age may affect the diagnostic relationships, so compare relationships for patients under 21 and over 21.\nAs binary outcomes are hard to plot, it may help to divide the range of each predictor into bins, and plot the value against the fraction of cases in the bin that were bacterial. Comment on whether any predictors should be transformed, and the shape of the relationships between predictor and response.\nFit a logistic regression to predict whether the patient has bacterial meningitis, using blood and CSF test results plus the features you derived in step 1. Include age and determine whether the other relationships vary with age. Ensure you hold out a test set before conducting your analysis. Make any necessary transformations and use diagnostics to check the relationships. Try to reduce your model: Are the calculated features more important than the raw test results? What is the simplest model you can construct that is an accurate predictor?\nEvaluate your model on the test set and report its performance. Show a confusion matrix.",

Magnitude is a logarithmic measure of brightness, with an increase of 5 representing a decrease in brightness by a factor of 100, and with a value of zero being represented (roughly) by how the star Vega appears in the night sky. In addition, there is a redshift measured for each galaxy; it represents by how much light from the galaxy is stretched (by the expansion of Universe) as it travels to us. Thus higher redshifts represent larger distances. The last measurement is log.mass, which is the base-10 logarithm of the galaxy stellar mass in units of solar mass; for instance, log.mass = 10 means that the galaxy has a mass 10 billion times that of the Sun.\n\nData preview\n\n Buzzard_DC1.csv \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable descriptions\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nu\nGalaxy magnitude in Rubin u band (320.5-393.5 nm)\n\n\ng\nGalaxy magnitude in Rubin g band (401.5-551.9 nm)\n\n\nr\nGalaxy magnitude in Rubin r band (552.0-691.0 nm)\n\n\ni\nGalaxy magnitude in Rubin i band (691.0-818.0 nm)\n\n\nz\nGalaxy magnitude in Rubin z band (818.0-923.5 nm)\n\n\ny\nGalaxy magnitude in Rubin y band (923.8-1084.5 nm)\n\n\nu.err\nUncertainty for u-band magnitude\n\n\ng.err\nUncertainty for g-band magnitude\n\n\nr.err\nUncertainty for r-band magnitude\n\n\ni.err\nUncertainty for i-band magnitude\n\n\nz.err\nUncertainty for z-band magnitude\n\n\ny.err\nUncertainty for y-band magnitude\n\n\nlog.mass\nGalaxy stellar mass (log-base-10 solar masses)\n\n\nredshift\nGalaxy redshift",

    "text": "Excess consumption of sugary drinks–soda, lemonade, sweet tea, and everything in between–has been blamed for a variety of health problems, like diabetes and obesity, which collectively cause billions of dollars of health costs each year. Some governments are taking action to reduce consumption of sugary drinks; most famously, the New York City Board of Health passed a regulation in 2012 banning the sale of sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces. Naturally there was a backlash, and eventually a court case ruled the board didn’t have the authority to make such a rule.\nRegardless of New York’s legal troubles, and setting aside the question of whether sugary drinks are solely to blame for the health problems they contribute to, we can ask the question “What kinds of regulations or serving suggestions would make people drink smaller amounts?” Perhaps by limiting size, changing serving methods, or with other small changes we could encourage people to drink less without an outright ban.\nResearchers conducted a series of experiments to try different strategies.

    "text": "Excess consumption of sugary drinks–soda, lemonade, sweet tea, and everything in between–has been blamed for a variety of health problems, like diabetes and obesity, which collectively cause billions of dollars of health costs each year. Some governments are taking action to reduce consumption of sugary drinks; most famously, the New York City Board of Health passed a regulation in 2012 banning the sale of sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces. Naturally there was a backlash, and eventually a court case ruled the board didn’t have the authority to make such a rule.\nRegardless of New York’s legal troubles, and setting aside the question of whether sugary drinks are solely to blame for the health problems they contribute to, we can ask the question “What kinds of regulations or serving suggestions would make people drink smaller amounts?” Perhaps by limiting size, changing serving methods, or with other small changes we could encourage people to drink less without an outright ban.\nResearchers conducted a series of experiments to try different strategies. The dataset here is from one of those experiments.\nParticipants were invited to the lab for 90 minutes, during which they sat in a cubicle and completed surveys and tasks for other unrelated psychological studies.

    "text": "Questions\n\nThe original paper measured the diversity of each group using something called “group faultline analysis”, which looks at the group members’ genders, countries of origin, and ethnicities to calculate a diversity score. The calculation is somewhat involved, so we’ll make a simpler score. For each group, calculate the number of unique gender-ethnicity-country combinations (such as female-white-Russia or male-Indian-USA) among the group members, and store this with the other group information such as team size and performance. Also calculate the average testosterone level for each group.\nDo exploratory data analysis to explore the composition of groups, the typical amount of diversity, and the typical amounts of testosterone. Note particularly that the data includes the logs of the cortisol and testosterone levels as well as the raw levels; does your EDA suggest you should use the logs or the raw values?\nThe data also includes participant ages. It’s possible age is related to hormone levels, as is gender, and that both are related to final performance (perhaps older team members have more relevant experience, for example). Consider carefully whether you want to include these variables in the model, and how you should include them—average team member age? Gender proportion?\nBuild a model predicting group performance (final.performance) using the group’s diversity score (be sure to control for the size of the group) and its average testosterone level. Is there an interaction between the two? Do your results resemble those presented by the original study?\nThe dataset also includes cortisol measurements. Cortisol is a hormone with many effects and roles in the body, but is commonly known as a “stress hormone” because its levels often increase because of sleep deprivation, intense exercise, and stress. Curiously, though cortisol is included in the data, it is not mentioned in the paper apart from an appendix. Include it in your analysis. Do stressed groups have better or worse performance? Does stress change the effect of diversity?",

Quarto files can contain R code, just like R Markdown, so your data description can include graphics and tables generated by R code embedded in the file, if you think this would be helpful to illustrate important features of the data. As you fill out the template, you can use RStudio’s “Render” button to see a preview of the finished page.\nThe template asks for:\n\nBasic metadata, such as the statistical methods applicable to the data, a short title, and your name. (All submissions are credited with the name of the submitter.)\nA description of the problem. This should be sufficient to motivate the analysis and help students understand the setting.\nA description of the data and the variables. It should be clear what each row of data represents and what all variables mean. Units of measure should be included whenever possible.\nReferences to the original source. If the source is an academic paper and the data is deposited in a third-party repository (such as Zenodo, Figshare, or Dryad), include references to both the paper and the archived dataset. When available, include the DOIs of the references.\n\nThe template is meant to prevent a common problem with course datasets: they get passed down from instructor to instructor, and eventually all information about the original source is lost. The dataset may be presented to students without context or important details (like units), and the instructor may not be able to find the original data or references to answer questions about the data.

Add these to your analysis. Comment on the results.\nTo test their theory about geographic area, the researchers used the lnarea variable as part of their model. Fit a regression model predicting price using lnarea, the control variables from question 2, and the country of origin. Do the results support the theory?\nOne concern may be that ham prices within a country of origin may be dependent.

For example, does the percentage of people using the Internet vary between income groups? Use graphical EDA or an ANOVA to study the differences, picking one year to focus on.\n(Fertility, alcohol consumption, forest area, and other variables may also be interesting to compare by income group.)\nExplore the relationship between Internet access and political stability for all countries in 2016. Is there a positive or negative relationship? Fit a regression model and interpret the coefficients.\nNow control for the country’s income group. Test whether an interaction term is necessary. Interpret the results. What does this interaction imply? Use a plot of the relationships to illustrate your results.\nMany other relationships between variables could be explored in EDA, regression, or ANOVA. For instance:\n\nCarbon dioxide emissions and PM 2.5 exposure, and how this relationship depends on GDP or income group\nGender parity in education (GenderEducation) and gender equality promotion by government policy (GenderEquality)\nThe strength of legal rights (LegalRights) and political instability and violence (PoliticalStability)\nDeaths in battle (BattleDeaths) and political stability (PoliticalStability)\nYears of compulsory education (CompulsoryEducation) and literacy rate (Literacy)\n\nOther variables may change over time in interesting ways, such as airplane travel (PlaneDepartures and PlanePassengers), forest area (ForestArea), and diabetes prevalence (Diabetes).\nFor any research question involving hypothesis tests, consider: What population can this data be said to be drawn from? Are tests necessary to generalize to that population?",

Because there are many varieties within the species, there are many varieties of seed that farmers can choose to plant, and each variety is suited for different growing climates and for different markets.\nHowever, in countries like Turkey, most farmers do not use commercially produced seeds certified to be all of one specific variety. They use seeds they obtain from their own crops or from other farmers, which may contain many different varieties of bean.

If seeds can be accurately sorted by computer, a machine could automatically sort seeds at high speed, allowing farmers to sort their crops, pick the best varieties for their fields and their markets, and sell their seeds to other farmers who want a specific variety.\nTo collect this data, researchers used a camera to take photographs of 13,611 beans of seven different varieties. (This study was conducted in Turkey, so the varieties are known by their Turkish names: Barbunya, Battal, Bombay, Calı, Dermason, Horoz, Tombul, Selanik and Seker.) The beans were of known variety.

Also choose your validation strategy carefully to ensure you can estimate your final model’s accuracy.\nExplore different ways to measure the accuracy of the classifier.

Choose summaries that would be the most useful to bean producers.\nWhich varieties are easiest to confuse with each other? Which are most obviously different?

Insects appear to be most attractive to blue and ultraviolet light, and less attracted by red or infrared light.\nPreviously, most outdoor high-intensity lighting—such as for street lights and parking lots—used sodium vapor lamps, a type of lamp that is very efficient for large lights but also produces a characteristic orange glow. Many cities and countries, however, are moving towards using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in outdoor lighting, since they have become affordable and highly efficient. LED lights promise to require less maintenance and cost less to operate. Also, they are not limited to the orange glow of sodium vapor lamps—they can produce whiter light. Some research suggests this is beneficial for safety, since whiter light makes roads and sidewalks easier to see. But it can also have some harms.\nOne possible harmful effect is to insects.

The researchers set up light traps: each trap contained a light bulb and captured any insect attracted by the light to enter the trap.\nThe researchers conducted their experiment by setting up six light traps, each with a different light bulb.

    "text": "Questions\nThese are adapted from questions used in notes for 36-707.\n\nWe are interested in the total number of insects collected in each trap (the Total variable) and how it relates to the light bulb type (Light Type). We also know that the location (Location), moon phase (% Moon Visible), mean night temperature (Mean Temp), and mean humidity (Mean Humidity) might affect insect activity. Conduct an EDA of these variables to determine what relationships the predictors may have with the response.\nConsider the study design. Because six traps were placed out each night, each with a different bulb (or no bulb), the traps were exposed to the same location, moon phase, temperature, and humidity. No bulb type has data from moon phases that are systematically different from the other bulbs, or was used on nights that were warmer than those for the other bulbs, or anything like that. This is known as a balanced design.\nComment on what this design choice means. Can location, moon phase, mean temperature, or mean humidity be confounding variables that would bias our estimates of the effect of bulb type? Do we need to incorporate them into our models to obtain an unbiased estimate of the causal effect of bulb type?\nObtain the mean number of insects trapped by each bulb. Display the means in a table. Which bulb attracts the fewest insects?\nNote there is one missing count (recorded as NA) that you may need to remove.\nSelect a GLM for the total number of insects collected as a function of bulb type, location, moon phase, temperature, and humidity. Use your EDA to guide your model choice, and produce any necessary diagnostic plots to validate your choice.\nProduce a table of coefficients estimated from your final model, including standard errors. Interpret, in words, the meaning of the coefficient for temperature, giving a 95% confidence interval for the size of the effect.\nConsider a night where the moon is 60% visible, the humidity is 60%, and the mean temperature is 15 °C. (These are roughly the average values in the data.) Produce a table of the predicted number of insects trapped by each bulb type at the La Kretz station on a night like this, giving 95% confidence intervals for each prediction. Does your result match the table from part 3?",
