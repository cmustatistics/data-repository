title: Submit a Dataset
---

The repository can always use new datasets, so we welcome submissions. Datasets
should meet a few requirements:

- The data must be publicly shareable. There should not be any licensing
  restrictions that prevent us from sharing it, or any human subjects ethics
  concerns or other limitations.
- The data should be in a standard, easy-to-use format, like CSV.
- There should be good motivation for interesting analyses of the data that
  would be appropriate for a course.
