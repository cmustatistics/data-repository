SFN covers a range of discussion topics, including\nstandard science topics like physics and chemistry but also a general discussion\nsection, politics, and a rather controversial religion section.\n\nSFN has about 800,000 posts since 2002. Most members are not professional\nscientists, though there are some “resident experts” who are academics or\nindustry scientists. There is a team of volunteer moderators who keep\ndiscussions from getting out of hand, deleting posts or closing discussions as\nnecessary. (Generally they try to post warnings rather than deleting anything.)\n\nOne section deserves special mention. For some reason, online science forums\nattract the attention of crackpots who believe they can prove the theory of\nrelativity wrong or write a new Theory of Everything. SFN gets quite a few of\nthem, and their posts get moved to the Speculations section. They tend to refuse\nto listen to evidence or argument, so eventually their topics get closed, but in\nthe mean time they attract the attention of many other members who enjoy an easy\nsmackdown. So you may notice some unusual trends in Speculations.\n\n## Data\n\nEach row is one topic; each topic can include many posts. This dataset includes\na random sample of 10,000 topics.\n\n### Data preview\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script

See below for names to go with the IDs. |\n| authors |\tNumber of distinct authors who participated in the discussion. |\ndeleted_posts |\tNumber of posts in the topic which have been deleted by a moderator. |\n| not_deleted |\tIf the entire topic has been deleted from view, this will be -1. |\n| pinned |\tIf 1, the topic has been \"pinned\" so it always appears at the top of the list of discussions. |\n| author_exp |\tThe number of days the topic starter was registered before starting the discussion. |\n| author_banned |\tRecords if the topic starter is currently banned.  |\n\n: [{{< meta datafile >}}](../data/{{< meta datafile >}})\n\nFor forum IDs, a categorization is given below.\n\n| Category \t| Forum IDs |\n|-----------|------------|\n| Homework help |\t33, 35 |\n| Physics |\t6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 18 |\n| Chemistry |\t5, 59, 60, 61 |\n| Biology |\t4, 15, 20, 52, 14 |\n| Mathematics |\t38, 11, 12, 16, 88 |\n| Medicine |\t22, 19, 21, 23 |\n| Engineering |\t17 |\n| Earth science |\t104, 105 |\n| Miscellaneous sciences |\t36, 25, 56 |\n| Philosophy and religion |\t103, 102, 27 |\n| General discussion |\t3 |\n| Politics |\t34 |\n| Speculations |\t29 |\n\nYou may see other forum IDs present; those are staff meetings, announcements,\nand other small one-off forums that may not be representative of the main\nscience discussion sections.\n\n## Questions\n\n1. Do some basic EDA. Are there any major outliers? Keep these in mind when you\n   perform your analysis.\n2. Which sections attract the most diverse group of authors to each discussion?\n3. What’s the relationship between views and posts? Does it vary by subforum?\n   Are there discussions which have disproportionately more views than they\n   should? Some discussions are prominent for some strange Google query and get\n   loads of visitors.\n4. Some discussions involve many people over many pages. Some involve the same\n   three people arguing for weeks. Which kind of discussion is more likely to be\n   closed by moderators? Which is more likely to be deleted?\n5. Do discussions with proportionally more deleted posts tend to get closed more\n   often? There’s a natural confounding effect with the length of the\n   discussion, so be sure to control for this.\n6. Perhaps some sections have a lower barrier to entry than others. It’s thought\n   that discussions in Speculations are much easier to join—-very little\n   technical background is required to argue with crackpots—-than discussions in\n   physics, chemistry, or other technical sections. Do you see evidence of this\n   in the data?\n7. Are members who have been registered for longer before starting the topic\n   more successful at starting active discussions?\n8. Moderators would like to know which topics are at greatest risk of needing to\n   be closed. Build a classification model to predict whether a given topic will\n   be closed, using only covariates that would be available while it is active.\n   (Total number of posts wouldn’t be available, for example, but the post rate,\n   number of posts per unique author, or fraction of posts deleted would be.)\n9. Did discussions tend to be more active in the early years of the forum, or\n   are more recent discussions more active? Consider the effect on post counts\n   and the number of authors.\n10. The overall number of posts may vary seasonally for several reasons. Perhaps\n    students post more in the summer, when they have spare time. Alternately,\n    perhaps they post more during the school year, when they have more science\n    questions. Do you see evidence of either trend in the data?\n\n## References\n\nData collected personally by the author.\n",
