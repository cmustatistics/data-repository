An experiment\n    attempts to understand why this is.\ncategories:\n  - ANOVA\ndata:\n  year: 2015\n  files:\n    - moral-rebels.csv\n---\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn 2008, three psychologists published a paper in the *Journal of Personality\nand Social Psychology* about \"moral rebels\": people who, despite being under\npressure to conform, instead rebel to do what they think is morally right.\nConsider [Frank Serpico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Serpico), for\nexample, a New York Police Department officer in the 1960s and early 70s who,\naware many fellow officers were corrupt, finally spoke out and brought evidence\nto the *New York Times*, leading to reform; or\n[Oskar Schindler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Schindler), a Nazi Party\nmember who nonetheless worked to save the lives of 1,200 Jewish workers during\nthe Holocaust.\n\nThe psychologists observed that moral rebels, though widely admired by\noutsiders, are often not well-appreciated by their peers who were involved in\nthe activities they rebelled against. (Frank Serpico, for example, was shot,\npossibly in a set-up by other police officers.) They hypothesized that peers of\nmoral rebels feel threatened: accepting the rebel would mean admitting their own\nbehavior was wrong, and it is easier to condemn the rebel than to admit you have\ndone wrong.\n\nThe psychologists performed several experiments to test their hypothesis. We're\ninterested in experiment 4, which tested the hypothesis that\nself-affirmation---performing some activity to make you feel good about\nyourself---would make it easier to accept the rebel. Their experiment found\nevidence for this hypothesis.\n\nHere's the experiment. Participants (undergraduate students) were assigned to\none of three experimental conditions: obedient, rebel control, or rebel\nself-affirmation. They were then asked to imagine that a burglary had just\noccurred, and they were then given three photographs of potential suspects,\nalong with descriptions of each suspect. The participants, on the basis of the\nphotographs and descriptions, were supposed to choose which suspect was most\nlikely the burglar, and fill out a form indicating why they made this choice.\n\nTwo of the photographs depicted white men. The third was \"Steven Jones\", an\nAfrican American man, whose description indicated he had a previous criminal\nrecord and no alibi---the descriptions were designed to make him the most\nlikely suspect.\n\nAfter making the choice and filling out the form, participants were shown a form\npurportedly from someone else who participated in the study (though it was\nactually prepared by the experimenters). Those in the \"obedient\" condition were\nshown a form picking Steven Jones as the burglar. Those in both \"rebel\"\nconditions were shown a form by someone stating \"I refuse to make a choice here\"\non the grounds that it's \"offensive to make a black man the obvious suspect\".\nParticipants were then asked a series of questions about the other participant\nwhose form they viewed.\n\nThe crucial difference was between the \"rebel control\" and the \"rebel\nself-affirmation\" groups. Participants in the \"rebel self-affirmation\", between\nfilling in their own form and viewing the fake form, were asked to write a short\nessay about \"a recent experience in which you demonstrated a quality of value\nthat is very important to you and which made you feel good about yourself.\"\nParticipants in the other two groups, as a placebo, were just asked to describe\nwhat they had eaten in the past two days.\n\nThis dataset presents the results of a replication of this experiment, conducted\nas part of the\n[Reproducibility Project: Psychology](https://osf.io/ezcuj/wiki/home/), a\nmassive project to redo experiments from 100 different papers from psychological\njournals, to determine if their results hold up when tested again. Our goal is\nto see if the self-affirmation task made participants feel better about the\nrebel than those in the control group.\n\n## Data\n\nThe data file contains results from 75 participants: 20 in the obedient\ncondition, 28 in rebel control, and 27 in rebel self-affirmation. (Assignment to\nconditions was done randomly.) The replication, instead of using undergraduate\nstudents, used participants from Amazon's\n[Mechanical Turk service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk),\nwho completed the task entirely online.\n\n### Data preview\n\n\n<h4><a href=\" https://cmustatistics.github.io/data-repository/data/moral-rebels.csv \"> moral-rebels.csv </a></h4>\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n

Is there a difference in how participants viewed the *other* participant\n   (based on the `Other.Work`, `Other.Friend`, and `Other.Respect` scores),\n   depending on which `Condition` they were in? Does the data support the\n   psychologists' original hypothesis?\n\n2. What about participants impressions of how moral the other participant was?\n   What does this mean for the research hypothesis?\n\n3. Repeat your analysis from question 1, but using `Self.Work`, `Self.Friend`,\n   and `Self.Respect`. Interpret and explain your results.\n\n4. Think about the experimental design. Does it adequately test the\n   psychological hypotheses? Are there any threats to its validity or\n   generalizability?\n\n## References\n\nB Monin, PJ Sawyer, MJ Marquez (2008).
