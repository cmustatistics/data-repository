A replication attempt collected much more data to try to confirm the hypothesis; is it supported by the data? A simple randomized experiment with continuous outcome and demographic controls.\ncategories:\n  - ANOVA\n  - linear regression\ndata:\n  files: religion-analytic.csv\n  year: 2017\n---\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn 2012, a study published in *Science* made the controversial claim that\n“Analytic Thinking Promotes Religious Disbelief”: people who tend to think\nanalytically report less belief in God. Moreover, the study reported on\nexperiments in which subjects performed tasks intended to make them think more\nanalytically, and found that afterwards, the subjects reported less religious\nbelief.\n\nThis was controversial for the obvious reasons; in the spirit of good science, a\nseparate team of researchers set out to perform one of the key experiments\nagain, with a larger sample size, to test if the reported effect really exists.\nThe original study included several experiments, but the new team focused on one\ntesting whether visual priming (showing people images meant to evoke particular\nfeelings) could have an effect on religious belief by priming people to think\nmore analytically.\n\nThe experiment, conducted exactly as done in the original study, went as\nfollows. Participants were told they were part of a study on memory, and shown\nfour photographs: half saw photographs of Rodin’s famous [The\nThinker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thinker) (intended to induce analytic\nthinking), and half saw photographs of Myron’s\n[Discobolus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discobolus), intended as a neutral\ncontrol.\n\nThen, in subsequent demographic questions, they were asked how strongly they\nbelieved in God, on a scale of 0 to 100 (0 meaning no belief and 100 meaning\nabsolute belief).\n\nThe replication study collected several times more data than the original study,\nfrom four sites: a community college, a private Lutheran university, a private\nCatholic university, and online (via Amazon’s [Mechanical\nTurk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk) service).\n\n## Data\n\nEach row is one experimental subject, randomized to see either Discobolus or The\nThinker.\n\n### Data preview\n\n\n<h4><a href=\" https://cmustatistics.github.io/data-repository/data/religion-analytic.csv \"> religion-analytic.csv </a></h4>\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"condition\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"site\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"religious\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"age\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"gender\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"discus\",\"2\":\"Online\",\"3\":\"50\",\"4\":\"24\",\"5\":\"Female\"},{\"1\":\"discus\",\"2\":\"Online\",\"3\":\"2\",\"4\":\"28\",\"5\":\"Male\"},{\"1\":\"discus\",\"2\":\"Online\",\"3\":\"0\",\"4\":\"21\",\"5\":\"Female\"},{\"1\":\"discus\",\"2\":\"Online\",\"3\":\"0\",\"4\":\"61\",\"5\":\"Female\"},{\"1\":\"thinker\",\"2\":\"Online\",\"3\":\"20\",\"4\":\"36\",\"5\":\"Male\"},{\"1\":\"thinker\",\"2\":\"Online\",\"3\":\"100\",\"4\":\"46\",\"5\":\"Female\"},{\"1\":\"thinker\",\"2\":\"Online\",\"3\":\"1\",\"4\":\"25\",\"5\":\"Male\"},{\"1\":\"thinker\",\"2\":\"Online\",\"3\":\"20\",\"4\":\"24\",\"5\":\"Female\"},{\"1\":\"discus\",\"2\":\"Online\",\"3\":\"100\",\"4\":\"33\",\"5\":\"Female\"},{\"1\":\"thinker\",\"2\":\"Online\",\"3\":\"100\",\"4\":\"61\",\"5\":\"Male\"},{\"1\":\"thinker\",\"2\":\"Online\",\"3\":\"60\",\"4\":\"25\",\"5\":\"Male\"},{\"1\":\"discus\",\"2\":\"Online\",\"3\":\"0\",\"4\":\"37\",\"5\":\"Male\"},{\"1\":\"thinker\",\"2\":\"Online\",\"3\":\"0\",\"4\":\"27\",\"5\":\"Female\"},{\"1\":\"thinker\",\"2\":\"Online\",\"3\":\"100\",\"4\":\"21\",\"5\":\"Female\"},{\"1\":\"discus\",\"2\":\"Online\",\"3\":\"100\",\"4\":\"48\",\"5\":\"Female\"},{\"1\":\"discus\",\"2\":\"Online\",\"3\":\"1\",\"4\":\"55\",\"5\":\"Female\"},{\"1\":\"thinker\",\"2\":\"Online\",\"3\":\"75\",\"4\":\"31\",\"5\":\"Female\"},{\"1\":\"thinker\",\"2\":\"Online\",\"3\":\"5\",\"4\":\"47\",\"5\":\"Female\"},{\"1\":\"discus\",\"2\":\"Online\",\"3\":\"95\",\"4\":\"24\",\"5\":\"Male\"},{\"1\":\"discus\",\"2\":\"Online\",\"3\":\"80\",\"4\":\"30\",\"5\":\"Female\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n\n\n### Variable descriptions\n\n| Variable | Description |\n|----|-------------|\n| condition |\tWhether the subject saw Discobolus ('discus') or The Thinker ('thinker') |\n| site |\tWhich site the subject was from |\n| religious |\tReligious belief, from 0 to 100 |\n| age |\tAge of the subject, in years |\n| gender |\tGender of the subject  |\n\n## Questions\n\n1. Perform basic EDA. Do the demographics of the participants differ by site?\n   What is the distribution of religious beliefs?\n2. Perform an analysis to determine if religious belief really does vary by\n   condition, as claimed in the original study. Do your results match? What do\n   you conclude?\n3. Is there any evidence that the effect (if any) differs by site, age or\n   gender?\n\n\n## References\n\nThe original experiment was: Gervais WM, Norenzayan A.
