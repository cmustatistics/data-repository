What policies work and what policies backfire? A factorial experiment.\ncategories:\n  - ANOVA\n  - logistic regression\ndata:\n  files: sugary-drinks.csv\n  year: 2017\n---\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nExcess consumption of sugary drinks--soda, lemonade, sweet tea, and everything\nin between--has been blamed for a variety of health problems, like diabetes and\nobesity, which collectively cause billions of dollars of health costs each year.\nSome governments are taking action to reduce consumption of sugary drinks; most\nfamously, the New York City Board of Health passed a regulation in 2012 banning\nthe sale of sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces. Naturally there\nwas a backlash, and eventually a court case ruled the board [didn't have the\nauthority to make such a\nrule](https://harvardlawreview.org/2015/03/new-york-statewide-coalition-of-hispanic-chambers-of-commerce-v-new-york-city-department-of-health-and-mental-hygiene/).\n\nRegardless of New York's legal troubles, and setting aside the question of\nwhether sugary drinks are solely to blame for the health problems they\ncontribute to, we can ask the question \"What kinds of regulations or serving\nsuggestions would make people drink smaller amounts?\" Perhaps by limiting size,\nchanging serving methods, or with other small changes we could encourage people\nto drink less without an outright ban.\n\nResearchers conducted a series of experiments to try different strategies. The\ndataset here is from one of those experiments.\n\nParticipants were invited to the lab for 90 minutes, during which they sat in a\ncubicle and completed surveys and tasks for other unrelated psychological\nstudies. The experimenters provided them a bag of potato chips at the start to\nmake them thirsty, then offered them iced tea or lemonade during the experiment;\nthey were given a small amount of money at the start to use to buy the drinks,\nand paid per drink.\n\nThere were two different manipulations. Participants were randomly assigned to\nreceive one of two sets of options:\n\n1. A medium drink in a 16 ounce cup, or a large drink in a 24 ounce cup\n   (\"typical\" condition), or\n2. A medium drink in a 16 ounce cup, or a large drink served in two separate 12\n   ounce cups (the \"bundled\" condition).\n\nThere were also two options for service, randomly assigned. Either\n\n1. A research assistant walked to each cubicle, asking each participant what\n   they'd like to drink (\"waiter-served\"), or\n2. Participants walked to the back of the lab to buy their drinks\n   (\"self-served\").\n\nAfter the 90 minutes were up, the experimenters recorded how many ounces each\nparticipant drank (by weighing their cups), how many calories they drank, what\nkind of drinks they ordered, and a few demographic variables. Participants were\nalso asked what their drink options were, to make sure they understood them.\n\n## Data\n\nThere were 623 total participants in this study, of whom 362 ordered a drink.\nEach row represents one participant.\n\n### Data preview\n\n\n<h4><a href=\" https://cmustatistics.github.io/data-repository/data/sugary-drinks.csv \"> sugary-drinks.csv </a></h4>\n<div

Perform basic EDA. What fraction of people ordered drinks, and of those who\n   did, what fraction ordered medium or large? Which type of drink was most\n   popular? Does there seem to be any difference depending on their drink\n   options or service style?\n\n2. Build a model to predict whether each participant orders a large drink,\n   depending on the portion (typical vs. bundled) and the type of service\n   (waiter-served or self service). Consider including an interaction if\n   necessary.\n\n    Did the portion type or service type affect drink orders? In what way?\n\n3. Participants didn't necessarily finish the drinks they ordered. Analyze the\n   number of calories they consumed, depending on the portion type and type of\n   service. Again, consider including an interaction if it seems necessary.\n\n    The researchers hypothesized that bundling may reduce consumption, since\n    having drinks in two separate cups makes it easier to realize how much\n    you're drinking. Is there evidence to support this? Does it seem to matter\n    whether participants had to give their order to an assistant or served\n    themselves?\n\n    Repeat your analysis, this time only including those who did not fail the\n    comprehension check at the end, which checked that they correctly understood\n    their drink options. Are the results consistent?\n\n4. The experiment wasn't intended for this purpose, but we can conduct a purely\n   exploratory analysis using this data to explore drink preferences. Of those\n   participants who ordered a drink, how many favored Snapple and how many\n   favored lemonade? Do preferences depend on sex, age, or ethnicity? Build a\n   model to predict the flavor of drink a participant ordered. How accurate is\n   it?\n\n## References\n\nLeslie K. John, Grant E. Donnelly, and Christina A.
