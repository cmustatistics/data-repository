Use an early dataset to explore its use for pneumonia.\ncategories:\n  - logistic regression\ndatayear: TODO\ndatafile: bloodletting.csv\n---\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nPhysician Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis (1787â€“1872) provided a now-classic\nanalysis which helped to debunk the practice of bloodletting.\n\nIn his study, Louis investigated records of pneumonia patients. Bloodletting was\nso common a medical treatment at the time, every patient Louis investigated had\nthe bleeding procedure performed on them. But some patients had been given the\nbloodletting later in the course of the pneumonia.\n\nConventional wisdom at the time was that bloodletting was beneficial, so the\npatients whose bleeding had been delayed should have fared worse than the\npatients who had been given bleeding early in the course of the illness.\n\n## Data\n\nEach row represents one patient in the study. There were 77 total patients.\n\n### Data preview\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"Age\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"DayFirstBled\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"FirstBleeding\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"NumBleedings\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"SickDays\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"int\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"Outcome\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"NA\",\"2\":\"1\",\"3\":\"early\",\"4\":\"3\",\"5\":\"10\",\"6\":\"lived\"},{\"1\":\"NA\",\"2\":\"1\",\"3\":\"early\",\"4\":\"2\",\"5\":\"12\",\"6\":\"lived\"},{\"1\":\"NA\",\"2\":\"1\",\"3\":\"early\",\"4\":\"2\",\"5\":\"14\",\"6\":\"lived\"},{\"1\":\"NA\",\"2\":\"2\",\"3\":\"early\",\"4\":\"3\",\"5\":\"7\",\"6\":\"lived\"},{\"1\":\"NA\",\"2\":\"2\",\"3\":\"early\",\"4\":\"2\",\"5\":\"10\",\"6\":\"lived\"},{\"1\":\"NA\",\"2\":\"2\",\"3\":\"early\",\"4\":\"2\",\"5\":\"12\",\"6\":\"lived\"},{\"1\":\"NA\",\"2\":\"3\",\"3\":\"early\",\"4\":\"3\",\"5\":\"19\",\"6\":\"lived\"},{\"1\":\"NA\",\"2\":\"3\",\"3\":\"early\",\"4\":\"3\",\"5\":\"29\",\"6\":\"lived\"},{\"1\":\"NA\",\"2\":\"3\",\"3\":\"early\",\"4\":\"2\",\"5\":\"20\",\"6\":\"lived\"},{\"1\":\"NA\",\"2\":\"3\",\"3\":\"early\",\"4\":\"NA\",\"5\":\"20\",\"6\":\"lived\"},{\"1\":\"NA\",\"2\":\"3\",\"3\":\"early\",\"4\":\"3\",\"5\":\"16\",\"6\":\"lived\"},{\"1\":\"NA\",\"2\":\"3\",\"3\":\"early\",\"4\":\"4\",\"5\":\"17\",\"6\":\"lived\"},{\"1\":\"NA\",\"2\":\"4\",\"3\":\"early\",\"4\":\"3\",\"5\":\"19\",\"6\":\"lived\"},{\"1\":\"NA\",\"2\":\"4\",\"3\":\"early\",\"4\":\"2\",\"5\":\"12\",\"6\":\"lived\"},{\"1\":\"NA\",\"2\":\"4\",\"3\":\"early\",\"4\":\"2\",\"5\":\"15\",\"6\":\"lived\"},{\"1\":\"NA\",\"2\":\"4\",\"3\":\"early\",\"4\":\"4\",\"5\":\"22\",\"6\":\"lived\"},{\"1\":\"NA\",\"2\":\"4\",\"3\":\"early\",\"4\":\"4\",\"5\":\"12\",\"6\":\"lived\"},{\"1\":\"NA\",\"2\":\"4\",\"3\":\"early\",\"4\":\"2\",\"5\":\"21\",\"6\":\"lived\"},{\"1\":\"NA\",\"2\":\"4\",\"3\":\"early\",\"4\":\"3\",\"5\":\"25\",\"6\":\"lived\"},{\"1\":\"NA\",\"2\":\"4\",\"3\":\"early\",\"4\":\"4\",\"5\":\"28\",\"6\":\"lived\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Variable descriptions\n\n| Variable | Description |\n|----|-------------|\n| Age | The age of the pneumonia patient (only available for patients who died) |\n| DayFirstBled | The day of the illness when bloodletting was first performed |\n| FirstBleeding | A categorical version of `DayFirstBled`, defined as \"early\" if the day of first bleeding as 1 to 4, \"late\" if day of first bleeding was 5+ |\n| NumBleedings | The total number of bloodlettings performed on the patient |\n| SickDays | The total duration (in days) of the illness |\n| Outcome | Whether the patient lived or died from the illness|\n\n: [{{< meta datafile >}}](../data/{{< meta datafile >}})\n\n## Questions\n\n1. One of P.C.A. Louis's analyses compared the survival rates of patients bled\n   early to those bled late (`FirstBleeding`). Construct a $2 \\times 2$\n   contingency table of the outcome (whether the patient lived or died) and\n   whether the patient was bled early or late. Calculate the survival rate for\n   each group. Interpret your results.\n2. Using your contingency table, conducted a $\\chi^2$ test of proportions. Is\n   the survival rate for each group different? State your null hypothesis, test\n   statistic, and *p* value, and interpret your results.\n3. Use a logistic regression model to predict the outcome based on the day\n   bloodletting was first performed (`DayFirstBled`). State the coefficient and\n   give a confidence interval. Do patients have better outcomes if they were\n   bled earlier or later?\n4. It's reasonable to assume that the number of bleedings also matters. Extend\n   your logistic regression to include this (`NumBleedings`) as a covariate.\n   Interpret both coefficients.\n\n\n## References\n\nOriginal research: Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis (1836), *Researches on the\nEffects of Bloodletting in Some Inflammatory Diseases*, Hilliard, Gray, &\nCompany.
