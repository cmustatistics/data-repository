This randomized experiment evaluates whether AI use reduces the time required to complete tasks.\ncategories:\n  - hierarchical model\n  - EDA\ndata:\n  year: 2025\n  files: metr-ai.csv\n---\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs generative AI tools became popular in 2025, a common use case was for\ngenerating code. Many software developers adopted AI tools (either\ngeneral-purpose services like ChatGPT and Gemini, or coding-specific tools like\nCursor and Copilot) to help them write and review code, and many reported\nfeeling much more productive with AI support. But productivity is difficult to\nquantify, so how could the productivity gain be tested?\n\nThis dataset comes from an experiment conducted by Model Evaluation & Threat\nResearch (METR), an independent group evaluating AI systems. METR organized a\nrandomized controlled trial in which 16 experienced software developers were\nrecruited and paid to participate. These developers worked on large open-source\nprojects; most had years of experience working on the same project, so they\nunderstood the code well.\n\nThe software projects all used code platforms like GitHub or GitLab, which\nprovide code hosting as well as bug tracking and collaboration features. The\ndevelopers provided a list of bugs, feature requests, and other tasks they\nintended to work on in the future, and were asked how long they expected each\ntask to take. The experimenters then randomly assigned teach task to be\ncompleted with AI assistance or without and paid the developers to complete the\ntasks. The developers recorded the amount of time taken for each task, so their\ntime estimates could be compared to the actual time taken.\n\nAll developers were given access to Cursor Pro, a popular AI-assisted code\neditor, and were given basic training on its use.\n\n## Data\n\nThe dataset contains 246 tasks, as well as the developer who completed each task\nand the time expected and actually required to complete it. Note that several\nvariables were only collected starting after many tasks had been completed, so\nthey are missing for tasks completed earlier.\n\nBesides the estimated time for each task, there are two actual times. Developers\ncompleted an initial version and submitted a \"pull request\", which allows other\ndevelopers on the project to review their code and give feedback. After this\npeer review, they then revised their code to make a final version. The time for\nrevision was tracked separately.\n\n### Data preview\n\n<h4><a href=\" https://cmustatistics.github.io/data-repository/data/metr-ai.csv \"> metr-ai.csv </a></h4>\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"dev_id\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"issue_id\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"predicted_time_no_ai\"],\"name\":[3],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"predicted_time_ai_allowed\"],\"name\":[4],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"prior_task_exposure_1_to_5\"],\"name\":[5],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"external_resource_needs_1_to_3\"],\"name\":[6],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"ai_treatment\"],\"name\":[7],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"initial_implementation_time\"],\"name\":[8],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]},{\"label\":[\"post_review_implementation_time\"],\"name\":[9],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"655\",\"2\":\"1\",\"3\":\"360\",\"4\":\"240\",\"5\":\"NA\",\"6\":\"NA\",\"7\":\"1\",\"8\":\"232\",\"9\":\"10\"},{\"1\":\"655\",\"2\":\"2\",\"3\":\"60\",\"4\":\"30\",\"5\":\"NA\",\"6\":\"NA\",\"7\":\"1\",\"8\":\"36\",\"9\":\"0\"},{\"1\":\"655\",\"2\":\"3\",\"3\":\"180\",\"4\":\"180\",\"5\":\"NA\",\"6\":\"NA\",\"7\":\"0\",\"8\":\"170\",\"9\":\"30\"},{\"1\":\"655\",\"2\":\"4\",\"3\":\"300\",\"4\":\"240\",\"5\":\"NA\",\"6\":\"NA\",\"7\":\"1\",\"8\":\"420\",\"9\":\"20\"},{\"1\":\"655\",\"2\":\"5\",\"3\":\"180\",\"4\":\"120\",\"5\":\"NA\",\"6\":\"NA\",\"7\":\"0\",\"8\":\"422\",\"9\":\"0\"},{\"1\":\"655\",\"2\":\"6\",\"3\":\"360\",\"4\":\"240\",\"5\":\"NA\",\"6\":\"NA\",\"7\":\"1\",\"8\":\"377\",\"9\":\"15\"},{\"1\":\"655\",\"2\":\"7\",\"3\":\"120\",\"4\":\"90\",\"5\":\"4\",\"6\":\"1\",\"7\":\"1\",\"8\":\"54\",\"9\":\"5\"},{\"1\":\"655\",\"2\":\"8\",\"3\":\"120\",\"4\":\"90\",\"5\":\"4\",\"6\":\"1\",\"7\":\"0\",\"8\":\"52\",\"9\":\"0\"},{\"1\":\"655\",\"2\":\"9\",\"3\":\"120\",\"4\":\"90\",\"5\":\"5\",\"6\":\"1\",\"7\":\"0\",\"8\":\"95\",\"9\":\"0\"},{\"1\":\"655\",\"2\":\"10\",\"3\":\"90\",\"4\":\"60\",\"5\":\"5\",\"6\":\"1\",\"7\":\"0\",\"8\":\"15\",\"9\":\"0\"},{\"1\":\"655\",\"2\":\"11\",\"3\":\"240\",\"4\":\"120\",\"5\":\"3\",\"6\":\"2\",\"7\":\"1\",\"8\":\"191\",\"9\":\"0\"},{\"1\":\"655\",\"2\":\"12\",\"3\":\"120\",\"4\":\"90\",\"5\":\"3\",\"6\":\"1\",\"7\":\"0\",\"8\":\"95\",\"9\":\"0\"},{\"1\":\"655\",\"2\":\"13\",\"3\":\"30\",\"4\":\"20\",\"5\":\"5\",\"6\":\"1\",\"7\":\"0\",\"8\":\"12\",\"9\":\"0\"},{\"1\":\"655\",\"2\":\"14\",\"3\":\"30\",\"4\":\"30\",\"5\":\"5\",\"6\":\"1\",\"7\":\"0\",\"8\":\"26\",\"9\":\"10\"},{\"1\":\"655\",\"2\":\"15\",\"3\":\"60\",\"4\":\"45\",\"5\":\"3\",\"6\":\"3\",\"7\":\"0\",\"8\":\"63\",\"9\":\"0\"},{\"1\":\"655\",\"2\":\"16\",\"3\":\"120\",\"4\":\"100\",\"5\":\"4\",\"6\":\"1\",\"7\":\"1\",\"8\":\"101\",\"9\":\"20\"},{\"1\":\"655\",\"2\":\"17\",\"3\":\"60\",\"4\":\"45\",\"5\":\"4\",\"6\":\"2\",\"7\":\"1\",\"8\":\"36\",\"9\":\"0\"},{\"1\":\"655\",\"2\":\"18\",\"3\":\"45\",\"4\":\"30\",\"5\":\"5\",\"6\":\"1\",\"7\":\"1\",\"8\":\"7\",\"9\":\"0\"},{\"1\":\"655\",\"2\":\"19\",\"3\":\"120\",\"4\":\"60\",\"5\":\"2\",\"6\":\"1\",\"7\":\"1\",\"8\":\"61\",\"9\":\"0\"},{\"1\":\"655\",\"2\":\"20\",\"3\":\"180\",\"4\":\"90\",\"5\":\"2\",\"6\":\"3\",\"7\":\"1\",\"8\":\"39\",\"9\":\"0\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n\n### Variable descriptions\n\n| Variable | Description |\n|----|-------------|\n| dev_id | Unique ID for each developer |\n| issue_id | Unique ID for each GitHub issue in the experiment |\n| predicted_time_no_ai | How long the developer estimated the issue would take *without* AI (minutes) |\n| predicted_time_ai_allowed | How long the developer estimated the issue would take *with* AI (minutes) |\n| prior_task_exposure_1_to_5 | How familiar the developer was with this type of issue (1 = least familiar, 5 = most); only collected starting halfway through the study |\n| external_resource_needs_1_to_3 | How many external resources, such as documentation, the developer expected to require to solve the issue (1 = none, 3 = many) |\n| ai_treatment | 0 if AI use was not allowed, 1 if AI use was allowed |\n| initial_implementation_time | Time taken by the developer to solve the issue and create an initial pull request (an initial solution) (minutes) |\n| post_review_implementation_time | Time taken by the developer to revise the pull request based on review feedback; only collected starting halfway through the study (minutes) |\n\n## Questions\n\n1. Construct plots or tables to compare expected and actual implementation time\n   for tasks with and without AI use. What is the evident effect of AI? How\n   accurate are developer time estimates, and do they tend to be too optimistic\n   or pessimistic?\n\n2. Since there are only 16 developers but 246 tasks, we have repeated\n   observations from each developer. We might expect differences between\n   developers, based on their experience, the type of projects they work on, and\n   the typical scope of tasks they define. A hierarchical or random effects\n   model might hence be a good idea.\n\n   Define a model for the initial implementation time, allowing for\n   developer-level effects. Interpret the results.\n\n   Should you allow the effect of AI to vary by developer? Consider adding the\n   necessary random effects and evaluate the model.\n\n3. It may also be useful to control for the amount of time the developer\n   expected the task to take, since there is a large amount of variation in the\n   size of the tasks. Accounting for this variance may give better results.\n   Define a model that controls for the time the developer expected the task to\n   take *without* AI, and interpret the results.\n\n## References\n\nBecker, Rush, Barnes, and Rein (2025).
