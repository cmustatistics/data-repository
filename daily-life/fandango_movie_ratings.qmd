## Motivation

How often do you look at movie ratings before deciding to a movie? Which sites do you use? Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, and Metacritic have been the most popular platforms for movie ratings for a long time, with Letterboxd now as an up-and-coming competitor. But rarely if ever, we see people place a lot of trust on Fandango ratings. Why? FiveThirtyEight writer Walt Hicker took notice of the difference between Fandango ratings and other platforms' ratings and scraped raw data from Fandango to figure out why.

Hicker finds that, by scraping the raw HTML script from Fandango website, Fandango presents a rounded rating but the raw average is in the HTML source code. This results in roughly 40% of the movies in sample were rounded up 0.3 to even a full half-star from the user ratings. It is unclear why Fandango does this, whether this is a designed rounding strategy or merely a bug, but this finding further proves how unreliable Fandango ratings are.

## Data

The dataset contains every film that has a Rotten Tomatoes rating, a RT User rating, a Metacritic score, a Metacritic User score, and IMDb score, and at least 30 fan reviews on Fandango that had a sale in 2015. The data from Fandango was pulled on Aug. 24, 2015.

## Questions

1. Perform an exploratory analysis of the Fandango fan ratings, comparing how
   much and how often the average `Fandango_Ratingvalue` differs from the
   presented aggregate score `Fandango_Stars`. How much and in what way do the
   values differ?

2. Split up the Fandango ratings by whether the raw average should be rounded up
   or rounded down, and compare them to the presented score `Fandango_Stars`.
   Does the result following the rounding rules you would expect?

2. Visualize the difference between Fandango ratings (both `Fandango_Stars` and
   `Fandango_Ratingvalue`) and other major platforms. Showcase the systemic
   differences however you like (hint: you can also use the user vote counts).
   Can the differences between Fandango's and other platform's ratings be
   explained by the rounding rules? If not, what other factors might explain
   them?

3. Test the difference between IMDB ratings and Rotten Tomatoes user ratings,
   the difference between Metacritic critic ratings and Rotten Tomatoes critic
   ratings, and the difference between Fandango stars and ratings from any other
   platforms. Is one platform more positive or negative than the others?
   Interpret the results.
